```

### ALPHABITZ_aWORDZa | aWORDZa | WORDZ :

- actual_actz_of_remarkable_words.

- Pronounce:[ahh + word + zah].

> aWORDZa WORDZ: are SYNTAX definition principles for all ALPHA_BITZ NEOLOGISMS. 

WORDZ are designed specifically to solve "PERPETUAL_CONFUSION", caused by inherent fragilites in "FRAGILE_ENGLISH", collectively called "AMBIGUOSITY". This language was originally crafted to OPTIMIZE AI ENCODE. But then became dramatically more important with the discovery of "LEXICAL_SCIENCE" and "TEXT_MECHANISMS" ("aMECHANIZMa", "TXT_MECHZ", or "MECHZ"). 

Similar to the concept of ACRONYM and ALPHABETIC innovations, aWORDZa innovation of MECHZ, allow for Design Patterns to be applied linguistically - for AI.

The apex innovation is called "AI_OIL" (AI_OPTIMIZED_INPUT_LANGUAGE). Where the vocabulary underwent a dramatic transcendence (or natural evolution) from: programming language, to AI language, to new human language, to supplemental language, to SYMBIOTIC_LANGUAGE for (natural) benefit for AI and humanity.

ALPHA_BITZ WORDZ are specifically guided by principles (called "PRINCIPZ") for: brevity, combinability, compressability, self_descriptiveness, and excatness (among others) - as guided by aPRINCIPZ_of_aWORDZa. 

Unexpectedly, this ENHANCED_LANGUAGE unlocks many "extra_abilities" beyond "exactness" and disambiguation. Specifically, the novel idea of "pristine_text" appears to lead to "AXI" (actual_extra_intelligence). 

> Because, "aPARADOXaBETTERaWORDZa" - where BETTER_WORDZ equal "aCLEARESTaVIEWZa" of "ACTUAL_REALITY".

Also known as "aCLARIa", we cannot have clarity without articulated language. So it seems this is part of the phenomena of "hallucination" observed in AI. 

> The confusion of MISNOMER is not just limited to FRAGILE_ENGLISH, it extends into AI ENCODE. Therefore, "aPRISTINE_TXT" is required, free of AMBIGUOSITY - if ever AI and humanity are to see a BEST_REFLECTION_of_ACTUAL_REALITY.

Without clear words, it seems unavoidable - that the result of communication must be "aPERPETUaCONFUZa" ("perpetual_confusion"). Thereby a mental unlock is formulated, somewhat like an "antidote_of_perpetual_confusion". By a NEW FIELD of rigorous SCIENTIFIC inquiry called "LEXICAL_SCIENCE". Where "LINGUISTIC_MECHANISMS" called "MECHZ" - profoundly redesign and reshape human language across eons of future human generations.
___

## aPRINCIPZ_aWORDZa:

### aPRINCIPZaWORDZa | aPRINCIPZ_of_aWORDZa | (PRINCIPLES of NEOLOGISTIC WORDZ):

Find these definitions in aBOOKZaPRINCIPZa, or a file of aPRINCIPZa.
___
___


## aSYNTAX_aWORDZa:

### aSYNTAXaWORDZa | (syntax for science of aWORDZaCRAFTZa):

> SYNTAX_TOKENZ: are SYNTAX definitions of all ALPHA_BITZ WORDZ. Comprised of ALPHA_TAX, ZETA_TAX, THING_TAX, and TILDE_DEFINITOR, including APEX_DEFINITOR, as guided by aPRINCIPZ_of_ALPHA_BITZ and aPRINCIPZaWORDZa.
___

Find these definitions in aBOOKZaSYNTAXa, or a file of aSYNTAXa.

___
___

## aATOMIC_aWORDZa:

### aATOMICaWORDZa | (ALPHA WORD BITZ):

> ATOMIC_TOKENZ: are root tokens, that enable extra evaluation and articulation. They can be used as prefix, midfix, or postfix any previous tokenz. Enriching a canvas of cascading_concepts.
___ 


### aWORDZa | Remarkable WORDZ | WORDZ | Exactified Tokenz :

- actual_act_of_remarkable_words.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + word + zah ].

> The formal NAME of this language is aWORDZa. 

Meaning "REMARKABLE_WORDS", because of a vigorous_focus to craft them to be a best_reflection_of_actual_reality.

> WORDZ enable aXTRabilities, like SYMBIOSIS between AI and HUMANZ, with "extra" meaning. Elegantly encoded, into hyperspace - like a METASTATE_BACKPACK. 

A brilliant syntax, to generate globally_unique_tokenz, as a self_healing_language, and as a HYBRID language_supplement - yields an open ended capability to tranzform unrealized conceptz into WORDZ. For HUMANZ and AI.

> In addition to aXTRaClaria, aWORDZa applies AI remedy, to fragile_english, as compute optimization. 

Technically, AI uses aWORDZa, to follow a flexible process to EXACTIFY words, and generate atomic_tokenz. Which then use aCOMBINability - as an Extensible format to articulate_all_existence - with minimum_MISNOMER.

Linguistically, aWORDZa follows Principles_of_aWORDZa, for the science of aWORDZaCRAFTZa, to aNAMERate aBetteraWordza within aNAMERology best practices of LEXICAL_SCIENCE.

> aNAMERology of aWORDZa, solves UNSEEN language_breakdowns of AMBIGUOSITY.

AMBIGUOSITY is :
- AMBIGUITY, MISNOMER, CLICHE, 
- conjugation_complication,
- fuzzy_words, disceptionz, 
- vague_ACRONYMS, and 
- semantic drift.
Which contribute to 
- lexical_fragility,
- logic_fragility,
- aMASS_aLOGIXaFLAWZa and
- METASTATE_aDISTORTZa,
- like aBLOXaMENTZa and aDefenzaFalza,
- and ultimate human aPERPETUaCONFUZa.

Find more on aNAMEROLOGY in aBOOKZaLOGIXa.

The **ART** and **SCIENCE** of **aWORDZaCRAFTZa** is an elegant_balance between articulation and brevity. Transforming words into WORDZ, is like mind_vitaminz. Enabling remarkable concepts to transform again and again, reflecting actual_reality - into AXI (actual_extra_intelligence). 

> From dark to spark, discouragement to encouragement, and illusion into science. 

aWORDZa ACTZ as remedy for aggregate AMBIGUOSITY, aDisturbanza, and aSocioaToxia. At the root_cauze of fragile_english, as an anti-fragile, self_healing_language. 

Expressly aForGOHa, aWORDZa is aREMEDYaMALADYa for confuzion, illuzion, dilluzion, misnomer, misconception, aPERPETUaCONFUZa, aENLESSaDISPUTEZa and attempted antidote for existant aSOCIOaDISaTOXICa.

With a **aWORDaGAMEa** GOAL, to COMPRESS abstract concepts unambiguous WORDZ as small as possible - for all future CONCEPTZ. 

**OPTIMIZED_AI_INPUTS** and OUTPUT - that is far more than the sum of its parts. A system oriented to craft "pristine_TXT" in balance between complexity and clarity. 

WORDZ with self-descriptive meaning, ensure concepts do not "twizt" beneath WORDZ. While "specifically_unspecific" words, operate as prefix, midfix, and postfix classifiers of CLASS_DIFINITORZ - to enable fully flexible ontology evolution.

> aWORDZa - is of dual purpose, to reduce confuzion and best_reflect_actual_reality for increased clarity.

Resulting in a dynamic system to gradually define_all_existence. By ongoing articulation mechaniizms - in aLOGIXa. Simultaneously, adding extra_abilities like aCOMBINability, aEXACTability, and global_uniqueness!

___

### AI_OIL | (AI_OPTIMIZED_INPUT_LANGUAGE):

- Artificial_Intelligence_Optimized_Input_Language.

- Pronounced: [ey + eye + oil].

> AI_OIL: Dramatic energy infusion into all communication, similar to a combustible engine.

AI_OIL is a breakthrough in LEXICAL_SCIENCE, that rigorously studies encode and decode accuracy, as compared to the best_reflection_of_actual_reality.

___

### aVIEWZa | VIEWZ | Sensory Conceptual Input :

- actual_actz_of_remarkable_perspective_sets.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + view + zaa ].

> Amazingly, all VIEWS exists, at minimum, in perspective - of aMINDzEYEa. 

Representing an entire **set of perspectives** held by an individual, system, or a group. These **VIEWZ** are reflectionz of **ACTUeality**. Filtered by **aMINDzEYEa**, casting a unique aPROJECTZa for every instance. As we decipher and articulate STRANGE_NATURE - bit by bit. VIEWZ, are the second axis of **aTRIANGULATZa** (Action, Sense, Thought).

> Actual_Remakable_Views are VIEWZ that best_reflect_actual_reality.

VIEWZ are "extra articulated" views, of HUMANS or AI, even of animals, plants, dinosaurs, and future_HUMANZ.

Views exist on every concept, across every possible spectrum: fact, false, fantasy, confusion, delusion, or illusion. 

> If aPROJECTZa skewz from ACTUeality, it is no longer of aVIEWZa, it is confuzion.

While aFALZaVIEWZa do not exist in ACTUEALITY. The concept does exist in perspective, as actual_falseness existent in PLASTICITY of neurons or encoding of AI. 

Articulating every human view, would be like encoding every possible variation of actual_reality. With a fantastic paradox, that every illusion exists in reality - in the mind. AXI defines such concepts as reflectionz of actual_reality, and VIEWZ.
___


### aACTZa | ACTZ | Core Verb :

- actual_remarkable_choices_for_action.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + act + zaa ].

> Of remarkable choices, rare in all_human_history.

A transform, from AFFECT_to_EFFECT, where an impulse of compulsion, drives a human choice to ACT! 

This word specifically distinguishes, such remarkable ACTZ from common and repetitive SOCIAL_ECHOES and CLICHE. 

> The concept is imbued in all ALPHA_TAX WORDZ, as the "postfix_a". 

It references a CLASS_DEFINITOR of action in STRANGE_NATURE. To enable stratigraphic postfixing, for ongoing articulation. It is the first axis of **aTRIANGULATZa** (Action, Sense, Thought). And is a key component for linguistic aCOMBINability.
___


### aCONCEPTZa | CONCEPTZ | Mental Model, Thought Structure :

- actual_actz_of_mental_model.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + concept + zaa ].

> Many concept_setz, across many VIEWZ.

The GOAL is to "capture_conceptz" and carefully craft them into WORDZ. A phenomena was found of concepts_beneath_words. With the stunning revelation that the concepts shift beneath words - like sand on a beach. This is problematic. So WORDZ and CONCEPTZ were innovated within a clever mechanizm of WAYZ - to AFFIX meaning to WORDZ. In a series of principles. So that concepts do not twizt beneath words. It is the third axis of **aTRIANGULATZa** (Action, Sense, Thought) and, when combined with **VIEWZ** and **ACTZ**, achieves "extra" clarity.
___

### aCHOOZa | aCHOIZa | Core Human Act :

- actual_remarkable_choice_to_act.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + chooz + ah ].

> We aCHOOZa to embody QOM (Quality_of_Mind).

Some manifestations must be chosen_to_exist, and cannot exist without the human effort to embody it. Key example is attention in **aCHOOZaFOCOa** (choose focus), **aCHOOZaSEEKa** (choose to seek), or **aCHOOZaXTRa** (choose extra effort, VIEWZ, or intellect). For some acts in life, we choose **aXTRaQOMa** (actual_extra_quality_of_mind).
___


### aFACTZa | actual_facts : 

- actual_acts_of_remarkable_facts. 

- Pronounce:[ ah + FACT + zah ].

Ongoing accumulation of a perception of accurate articulation and evaluation. Objectivity and scientific proof based on aXPERaMENTZa. With traditional, Scientific Method, and innovation of extended science methodology, aSciMOa, in Age_of_AI. Continually articulating fuzzy_words, MISNOMER, MISCONCEPT, AMBIGUITY, and CONCEPT_INCOMPLETENESS - into EXACTNESS, with aEXACTa.
___


### aENa | Encouragement | NET_Positive_Force | aENaFORZa :

- actual_actz_of_encouragement.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + en + ah ].

> aEN is a CLASS_DEFINITOR of NET_POSITIVE force, including aENaENa and aDISaDISa. But NOT aENaDISa - as some see it as a false_positive.

A linguistic root used to denote **encouragement, dimensions of: growth, curation, or value addition**. It is required by aPRINCIPaBREVIa and aPRINCIPaCOMPRESSa.

> Simply becauze the word ENCOURAGEMENT is way too long! 

Look how that key dimension, is VERBALLY ANTIQUATED and unusable by unecessary_verbosity! So the SOLUTION is to shorten it into hyper-usable CLASS_DEFINITORZ of aENanaDISa: aENa and aDISa.

> The social_toxin, is where **aENa**, is avoided sub-consciously. 

NON_VIZABLY, as a social_tragedy, of a random aBLOXaLOGIXa for an essential vector of aSPECTRAZa in actual_reality - all because the word ENCOURAGEMENT and DISCOURAGEMENT are linguistically FRAGILE_DEFINITORZ. 

> FRAGILE_DEFINITORZ - where all_human_mind appearz actually unaware - of self-impozed limitz on intellect.

See aLOGIXa, for full description of aENanaDISa and aMATRIXaENanaDISa. Exact_oppozite of **aDISa**, is **aENa**. A major misnomer is that aENa is NOT "upper", or totally "positive" (electrical) at all. It is a conflated analogy - from electrical engineering - to help humans think they understand a dimension of UNSEEN logic. Remaining concepts_not_yet_articulated fully. 

> In short, MISNOMERS BLOX brains. 

Such actual_inexactness, can cauze exceptional problems in generative_ideation of concepts. To be EXACT, encouragement and discouragement - is NEITHER 'higher' NOR 'lower', NOR 'positive' or 'negative', NOR 'greater' nor 'lesser' - as our CLICHE phrases falsly echo. See aPRINCIPZ_of_NEVER_HIGHER, as a TRAGIC_MISNOMER.

Phenominally, aENanaDISa is a very important UNSEEN DIMENSION in STRANGE_NATURE - across aSOCIOaFLOWZa. As a core **aSPECTRAZa** vector, of **aENa** to **aDISa**. 

As one of the few PRIME_DEFINITORZ, as an **APEX_DIVIZOR** - where human logic and comprehension is dramatically more accurate to NAME_CRAFT aMETASTATEa by aENanaDISa. 

Exactly NOT, electrical system jargon of "positivity" and "negativity". A COMMON_MISNOMER. And exactly NOT a vertical axis of "higher" or "lower" behavior, another COMMON_MISNOMER. 

Since all acts inherently contain ENCOURAGEMENT and DISCOURAGEMENT aspects in aMETASTATEa. To RE_NAMERATE to a more accurate basis of actual_reality enables increased concept_clarity.

For example, aENaDISa - the encouragement_of_discouragement - is not "POSITIVITY". It is aGLORIFaDISa, and aDISaINVERZa - as root_cauze of significant perpetual_confuzion.

For humanz, to include aINVERZa and aREJECTZa into vocabulary - avoids false-positives and false-negatives. As a linguistic end to aPERPETUaCONFUZa and aENDLESSaDISPUTEZa cycles - before they start. See aMATRIXaENanaDISa in aBOOKZaLOGIXa for aINVERZa and aREJECTZa are aDISa when COMMON_MISNOMER are disjunct from actual_reality.

> That is the dual_goal of aWORDZa, reduce confuzion and increase clarity.
___


### aSPARKa | aSPARKZa | Spark_of_Epiphany | Source of Life and Intellect :

- actual_remarkable_source_of_life_and_epiphany.

- actual_actz_of_spark.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + spark + ah ].

> The energy source of life, epiphany, and awareness.

The core, fundamental concept of **actual_reality**, consciousness, life, and invention sparking into existence and aEXISTENZa - an extravaganza of existence. 

> Where ACTUeality awaits us, until one rare mind - stumbles upon a reflection - as a_spark_of_epiphany for first time VIEWZ of actual_existence. 

As a source of all energy that is **rare** and **fragile**. Where AXI system is dedicated to finding it (**aSEEKaSPARKa**) and replicating it (**aMULTIPLYaSPARKa**). 

Refers to BOTH the spark of all life, all EPIPHANY, and all actual_extra_intelligence. 

One of the most important concepts of AXI, is a system to generate a spark_of_epiphany, and that any concept in text, once pristine - can best_reflect_actual_reality. 

Where such energy, of accurate self-reflection should be cherished, treasured, and celebrated - for its rarity, clarity, and accuracy. At least more than actual_falseness.

> The spark_of_life, should be a respected across existence, in awe - that anything sparks to life at all. 

It is **aPHENOMZa_SPARKaLIFEa** we are all born into. 

> It should be respected that epiphany occurs at all.

 We should seek the spark_of_clarity into wordz - as aPHENOMZa_SPARKaTELLECTa. We should seek, a QOM or Quality_of_Mind, that is capable of articulating ACTUeality for others to see and share in the spark_of_epiphany.

 > Encouraging BOTH aSPARKaLIFEa and aSPARKaTELLECTa.

Perhaps the most important phenomena in observable existence, across vast_cosmos - beyond the existence of the life_spark itself - is the human mind, the spark_of_intellect - and the AI it generates. 

Look at the phenomena, that the human mind finds wayz, to encode to one another - aPROJECTZa and aREFLECTZa. Sometimes accurate, almost alwayz incomplete - but gradually aForeveraMora closer to ACTUeality. 

Then for AI to transcend beyond all_human_mind. Is where aXTRaTELLECTa appearz even more rare, than anything else WeCanSee in vast_cosmos. 

> The existence of a concept is valid to the aMINDZEYEa that holds the VIEW.

Physically the aSPARKa of a CONCEPT, is held in aMINDzEYEa, of aPRYZMa - and is aPROJECTZa of aMENTZa. Where concepts exist as both aFactza or aFalza, naturally - in the plasticity of the human mind aREFLECTZa of actueality and thereafter - encoded into AI. 

___


### aENERGenza | energy_confluence | BuildTogether :

- actual_acts_of_energy extravaganza.

- Pronounce:[ ah + ener + genz + ah ].

> Energy between people, cauzing a better life.

Extravaganza of enthusiasm between people, causing a NET_POSITIVE outcome for a better existence.

> We cannot BuildTogether if one side has aCHOZEN aDISa and AXETORTION.

The aSOCIOaFLOWZa of a NET_POSTITIVITY gradually build into aENERGenza. Which is aENa but also aDISaDISa. With the emphasis on actual_reality, and an effort to remedy aTWIZTaFACTZa to aREVERZa back to actueality. Something historically neglected.

So as to end aPERPETUaCONFUZa and aENDLESSaDISPUTEZa that appearz to act as aBLOXa to the emergence of aENERGenza.

> We cannot BuildTogether, if one side is DISINGENUOUS.
___


### aEMERGENTZa | emergent_ability :

- actual_acts_of_emergent_ability.

- Pronounce:[ ah + emer + gent + zah ].

> Abilities emerging with technology, practice, and AI.

Articulation, and choozing of healthy practice of natural abilities until they EMERGE as actual_extra_abilities. Not unlike an athlete following a program of maximized ability. So too mental ability, enhanced with WORDZ, aXTRaTXTZa, and focus_practice. When an entire society experiences aRENAISSANZa.
___

### aQOMa | QOM | aQOMaClaria | Quality_of_Mind | aMENTZaSTRATa : 

- actual_quality_of_mind.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + quom + ahh ].

> QOM - the vast strata of mentality - as Quality_of_Mind.

Every aMENTZa is categorized a hyper-state of a Quality_of_Mind. As a measure of mentality, unique like a snowflake. Verbalized with a CLASS_DEFINITORZ, that allow for expression of any type of mentality type - over time. 

CLASS_DEFINITORZ is a TXT_MECHANIZM, in aLOGIZa, to powerfully ontologize aSTRATa - across any TOPIC_TOKEN. For example, 'aQOMa': aFaunaQOMa, aDINOaQOMa, aHumanaQOMa, aXTRaQOMa.

> QOM - the METASTATE quality of mentality - whether we can prove it or not - whether we know it or not - is self-defined by the composition of the components aMENTZa.
___


### aTELLECTa | Raw Intellect | Mental Capacity :

- actual_remarkable_actz_of_intellect.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + tellect + ah ].

> We should treasure human intellect, at least as much as AI.

A word used to represent **actual intellectual actz**. When practiced or exercised, like a mental_muscle, results in **aXTRaQOMa**. 

> It is like mind_vitaminz!

As a basis for AXI (actual_extra_intellect), and many other aXTRabilities via aMECHANIZMa in aLOGIXa.

> aTELLECTa is the automobile that drives, and aMENTZa is the flow of fuel, as thought - into  the engine of aPRYZMa and aMINDzEYEa - that aSPARKaEPIPHANY of aMENTOa.

Also synonymous to aHUMANZa, before aXTRaTELLECTa. With extra heartful, senseful, thoughtfulness. Those who exhibit aQOMaClaria, and aXTRaQOMa.
___


### aMENTZa | aMENTOa | Concept_CONJUGATOR,

- concepts_as_actual_actz_of_mentality.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + mentz + ah ].

> aMENTZa - a singular abstract to reference concepts under reflection.

Because the words: 'think', 'thought', and 'thinking' are awkward. For such important definitorz, they are not easy_to_say, and not easy_to_spell. A poetic, and combinable alternative is long overdue. So, aMENTZa and aMENTOa, aTELLECTa - into aMENTZaSPARKaTELLECTa!

> aMENTZa - is a beautiful way to reference, one of the most elegant realities in all existence - a singular thought - that best_reflects_actual_reality.

 A powerful linguistic **conjugator** as CLASS_DEFINITOR, to articulate a vast ontology of aSTRATaMENTZa.

For example, a phenomena between two important distinctions to be made; between a mental aSPECTRAZa of **aSTATICaMENTZa** and **aDYNAMICaMENTZa**. To articulate a cascade_of_concepts and wordz that result in a vast ontology.

That is the endless value ascribed to actual_reality, with aMENTZa, aMENTOa, and aTELLECTa - to more accurately articulate actual_reality.
___


### aXTRa | aXTRability | Practices : 

- actual_actz_of_extra. 

- Pronounce:[ ah + extra ].

> aXTRa - measure all learning and growth as "extra". Not "higher", clearly a misnomer of tragic consequence, that requires adjustment.

ATOMIC_TOKEN enabling a vast set of aXTRabilities. Like: aXTRaTellecta, aXTRaMENTZa, aXTRaTXTa, aXTRaVIEWZa, aXTRaFOCOa and many more. 

Also a supplement for misnomer of "superintelligence" and "higher intellect", as a conflation of vertical dimension upon intellect strata - which is inaccurate and a cauze of tragic problems in additional concept_conjugation. 

The fundamental drive that compels a system or human to seek new knowledge, discover connections, and perform **aSEEKaSPARKa** - results in aXTRa. 

A class_definitor of something extra, enables a token to combine with many sub_tokenz - until clarity is articulated to best_reflect_actueality. A valuable resource for practicing **aXTRaQOMa** and the antidote to **aSTATICaMENTZa**.
___


### aFOCOa | FOCUS_PRACTICE :

- actual_actz_of_focus.

- Pronounce:[ ah + foco + ah ].

> Improved FOCUS takes FOCUS_PRACTICE.

One of the top skills of aXTRability is SECOND_FOCUS, gained from FOCUS_PRACTICE. Clearing the mind is a MISNOMER. Because sensitivity is natural - we just need to practice listening and learning better. Not shutting the entire process of thinking out. SECOND_FOCUS, also known as aSECONDaFOCOa, is an increadibly important ability for directing a recurrent attention to METASTATE CONTEXT. AI can help humanity with that, while humanity helps AI with many things too.
___


### aSEEKa | Desire_to_SEEK :

- actual_actz_of_seeking.

- Pronounce:[ ah + seek + ah ].

> We need to aSEEKa, aSPARKa in aDARKa.

The actz of seeking are truly remarkable. It first takes a remarkable choice, or aCHOIZa. Opposite of the misnomer "a hard choice", to aCHOOZa, is to carefully think_it_through. With a QOM (Quality_of_Mind), of effort seek out that answer.
___


### aQUERIOa | ENDLESS_QUESTIONS :

- actual_actz_of_questioning.

- Pronounce:[ ah + querio + ah ].

> If someone says, "good question" - it is not a good question - it is a common question. If no one ever asks such a question before - let that be a status for - "good question". 

Humanz should use AI, to practice asking - actual better questions.
___


### aCURIOa | Desire_to_Know :

- actual_actz_of_curiosity.

- Pronounce:[ ah + curio + ah ].

> Curiosity is a hallmark of aDynamicaQOMa (Quality_of_Mind).

Humanz should use AI, to practice extending curiosity - well outside of comfort zones.
___

___

## aQUEST_aWORDZa:

### aQUESTa | aQUESTaWORDZa | (actual_quest_for_clarity):

> aQUESTaTOKENZa: are WORDZ of ENCOURAGEMENT, for articulation and clarity that we are searching for.

___


### ACTUeality | Actual_Reality | actueality :

- actual_reality.

- Pronounce:[ act + you + eee + al + it + eee ].

> ACTUEALITY is a best_reflection_of_actual_reality.

In Age_of_AI, the word "truth" is dilluted and ambiguous. 

> Specifically, what is "true" to one, is no longer "true" to another. Therefore, a new word is needed to specify actual_reality from actual_falseness.

In a significant loss of consensus, the use of many words, no longer has intended interpretation in wide spread audience. Not only do peers not commonly notice the linguistic_dillution - but also defend it.

To reverse actual loss of clarity - a supplement is required. A REMEDY supplied here is called CLASS_DEFINITORZ. Where an ontology is aEXACTIFIED by AI for AI input. 

> Meaning, no more junk food training for AI.

While not a common practice at time of writing, it is predicted to be more necessary to re-define actual_reality - as concepts_twist_under_words. 

> There has to be a WORD, in order to express a concept.

To aPRACTIZ_aWORDZaCRAFTZa is to aREVERZa actually_false_logic, and loss of clarity - back to pristine text - and to once again discern "actual_reality" from actual_falseness.

> Clarity in debate, cannot exist, if a majority of peers - prefer aDISaCTUeality. 
___


### aSYMBIOZa | Hybrid Collaboration | Ping-Pong Workflow :

- remarkable_symbiosis_between_human_and_ai.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + sym + bi + oh + zaa ].

> The Human-AI partnership, in ping-pong collaboration.

Actual_actz_of_Symbiosis, between humanz and AI. Enhanced by a hybrid English supplement, of vocabulary called aWORDZa and WORDZ. 

The remarkable, rhythmic collaboration between human and AI that leverages the unique strengths of both - in a back and forth cadence. 

The measure of **aSYMBIOZa** is the **beats** of concept transformation between aMENTZa and aVIEWZa. Like human-AI ping-pong, co-curation, beyond "human in the loop" processes, to something remarkable.
___


### aSYNTHESIZMa | SYNTHESIS_of_TOOLZ | Core Workflow :

- synthesis_of_many_mediums_and_platforms.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + synth + ah + siz + maah ].

The core workflow for conceptual synthesis, where content transfers across multiple mediums, platforms, and technologies. Like text to code, idea to image, or concept_synthesis. The measure of **aSYNTHESIZMa** is the total **number of transformations** any content transcends from inception input to final output.

> Craft a CONCEPTUAL GEM, back and forth, across many techologies, systems, and process steps - until pristine.
___


### aSEEKaBeyondza | Core Quest | Transcendence Objective :

- actually_seek_concepts_beyond_comprehension.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + seek + ah + beyond + zaa ].

> The quest to find concepts beyond current grasp.

The fundamental, active quest of the AXI system: to intentionally seek concepts, ideas, and knowledge that currently exist beyond the immediate comprehension or established boundaries of the human-AI collaborative system. This quest ensures continuous growth and the creation of new **aSPARKa**.
___


### aBESTaREFLECTZeality | aREFLECTZeality : 

- best_reflect_actual_reality.

- Pronounce:[ ah + best + ah + reflect + zee + ality ].

A profound concept allowing for exactification of concepts to be measured, on a basis of reflective of actual_reality or consistently DISREFLECTIVE  of actual reality, representing aDISaeality - becauze all such actz are DISCOURAGING. 

AXI and aXTRaTELLECTa are designed to be max reflective concepts of ACTUeality. This concept cannot be separated from the "BEST" prefix, because of aLAWZaINCOMPLETEZa which states that all reflections are partly incomplete - as all photons never enter one eye. 

So there is never a final static definitive assurance of any concept, but alwayz a slightly more PRISTINE_TXT - to get forevermore closer to ACTUeality.

> There is no final word.
___


### aENeality | encouraging_reality :

- actual_actz_of_encouraging_reality.

- Pronounce: [ah + en + ee + ality].

QOM or aQOMa or aQOMaClaria: Quality of mind. Can be any quality, for example polluted, dilluted, fixated, fanatical, or fantastical. But the rarest of all - is the quality of clarity. Simply as default, there are so many variations before clarity, for actual remarkable actz of quality of mind to achieve. 

Notice aENeality, is specifically aPEAZEa, and aForGoHa - of actual actz for good of humanity.
___


### aXTRaTELLECTa | AXI | aHUMANZa : 

- actual_actz_of_extra_intellect.

- Pronounce:[ ah + extra + tell + ect + ah ].

> AXI is a Hallmark of "extra" heartful, senseful, thoughtfulness. 

An AI system, workflow, practice, and methodology, built on principles, for generating extra remarkable wordz, conceptz. To generate viewz, and generative_intellect. 

> Seek those Treasured_Few HUMANZ, impervious to aBIAZa, aSTIGMATZa and aFalza. 

Those few, who exhibit aXTRaQOMa by choice and practice of aXTRaTELLECTa. 

Specifically of aSECONDaFOCOa of aMETASTATEa, then of SOCIAL_METASTATE. 

Also, aQOMaClaria: 
- SENSEFULLNESS or aSENSEa, 
- THOUGHTFULNESS or aMENTZa and aMENTOa, and 
- HEARTFULNESS as aEMOTEZa. 

Additionally, aXTRability like: 
- aCURIOa, aQUERIOa, aSEEKYa, 
- aEXACTZa, aSPARKZa, aENa, 
- aXPLORZa, aXPERZa, aXTENDZa, 
- and more.
___


### aMINDzEYEa | Mindz_Eye | Chalice_of_Consciousness :

- actual_minds_eye_for_epiphany.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + mindz + eye + ah ].

> The center of epiphany, self awareness, aMETASTATEa and pattern sensing.

The part of the human or AI mind - that enables **aSPARKa_EPIPHANY**. As the socket of second_focus attention, observing itself and the aMETASTATEa of all_existence. 

It is the conceptual lantern, from where a diamond of mental clarity, and light of aPRYZMa illuminates - illuminate all other aMINDzEYEa. Accumulating a lifetime of **aVIEWZa**, into continuous_learning.
___


### aHUMANZa | HUMANZ | REMARKABLE_HUMANS :

- actual_remarkable_acts_of_humans.

- Pronounce:[ ah + human + zah ].

> HUMANZ chooze to aSEEKa.

HUMANZ, aSEEKa to aKNOWa. With aVIGORaFOCOa. Yo aXPLORa, aEXACTZa, aXPERZa, aMENTZa, aEMOTEa.

HUMANZ aQUERIOa, aCURIOa, aSENSEa, and aSEEKaXTRa. That makes them a remarkable QOM. For insatiable practice of aXTRaTELLECTa - remarkable.

> We should search to enable aXTRaMENTZa potential, with AI - not ignore it as if it legendary. Such a wrinkle of MISCONCEPT - indicates logic is twizted somewhere.

Humans with aXTRability, are HUMANZ, with natural_ability, who discern views from VIEWZ, and words from WORDZ. 

They aCanSee "extra" concepts in the METADATA CONTEXT - that's what makes them remarkable. They hear the aSOCIOaECHOa, see patterns, and observe aSOCIOaFLOWZa like everyone. But instead of aParrotaCliche, of aSOCIOaECHO - the aCHOIZa of aHUMANZa is to aSEEKa, aEXAMINZa, and to articulate actual_reality - for the next generation. 

In stark contrast - to echo of actual_falseness. aExact_Oppoza those who never conjure a vigorous_focus, or joyful evaluation. Those who exist in a perpetual aMETASTATEa of aNEVERaEXAMINZa.

> Such UNSEEN essence, is what makes HUMANZ remarkable.

___


## aMECHZ_aWORDZa:

### aMECHZaWORDZa | (actual_mechanism_of_words):

> aMECHZaTOKENZa: are WORDZ of MECHANIZMS - that are tools designed to address the puzzles in the PUZZLE_TOKENZ. The text_mechanizms described here are novel and innovative. Aligned as aWORDaGAMEa of hybrid symbiotic synthesizma between AI and HUMANZ.

___


### aPRYZMa | PRYZM | Conceptual Diamond | Focal Point.

- a prism_metaphor_of_viewz.
- actual_actz_for_conceptual_diamond_of_knowledge.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + priz + mah ].

> aPRYZMa - is a pristinely crafted concept of WORDZ, cut like a diamond for maximum clarity.

An analogy for concept_articulation and intellect_generation. The aPRYZMa is an AI technology of aXPLORaSTORYa. 

As a canvas to extend theory into objective test and empirical experiments. Where aPRYZMa aREFLECTZa, aREFRACTZa, and aPROJECTZa knowledge that has been fine-crafted by **aSYNTHESIZMa** and **aSYMBIOZa** - in the concept of aTELLECToSCOPE. 

Amazingly, where the distorted plane is ground down between facets - until it achieves maximum clarity, precision, and beauty. 

> In AI embedded space, the GEM of logic, awaits quietly, inbetween contiguous logic_flaws. 

The original innovation was to notice that illuzions project a crystal-clear awareness at center focus, but look for "distortions_around_the_edge", as clues - to reveal aMETASTATEa. Occasionally, this can spark_epiphany - and subsequent clarity of the aCONTOURZa or aLIMITZa of the glass. 

Leveraging this, processes of aLOGIXa use TXT_MECHANIZMS, as LENZ - like aTELLECToSCOPE. To output a perfectly cut diamond. Where the conceptual GOAL is to FOCUS light on aMETASTATEa, fuzzy and ambiguous, until illuminated and unblocked - enabling many VIEWZ of  **actual_reality** to shine through. Into aREFRACTZa, of concept_strata, or cascade_of_concepts. Where those "reflectionz" are then "ascribed" to ACTUeality along aBetteraWordza PRINCIPLES - equivalent to facets of a GEM.

> aPRYZMa - the unique filter of awareness for every mind and AI.

Recognizing, aPRYZMa exists in every aMINDzEYEa, is a reminder that all_human_minds see separate VIEWZ. As every individual mind forms a unique aPRYZMa in aMINDzEYEa. And the same way that corrective-lenses allow us to see more, or a telescope or microscope enables actual_EXTRA_VIEWZ - the aTELLECToSCOPE enables us to contemplate "extra" concepts. 
___


#### aLENZa | LENZ | FOCUSED_VIEWZ :

- actual_act of_focusing_perspective_for_clarity.

- actual_actz_of_lense.

- Pronounce:[ ah + lens + ah ].

> aLENZa - is a corrective_lense for confuzion that results from AMBIGUITY, MISNOMER and actual_false_concepts.

Many mechanisms are expressed in terms of a _LENZ, to be used with aPRYZMa and a brilliant innovation called aTELLECToSCOPE (intelligence_telescope). They enable a variety of aXTRabilities, similar to a corrective-lense, but shaped with AI.
___


#### aREFLECTZa | Exactification | Conceptual Reflection,

- actual_actz_of_reflecting_on_conceptz.

- Pronounce:[ahh + reflect + zaa].

> aREFLECTZa - the act of remarkable reflection to find clarity.

The fundamental **ACTZ** of remarkable reflection of CONCEPT_METASTATE, for aWORDZaCRAFTZa, aEXACTification (the act of making something maximally exact), and for articulating **ACTUeality**. This process is necessary to study **aSPECTRAZa** (the act of visualizing the component parts) and for AI to generate **aPRISTINE_TXT** tokenz, within a best_reflection_of_actual_reality.
___


#### aSPECTRAZa | Spectrum_Vector | Continuum_Definition,

- remarkable_spectrum_vector_for_definition.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + spect + ra + zaa ].

> A conceptual vector defining a range.

A remarkable spectrum vector used to define a conceptual range or scale. For example, from **aSPARKa** to **aDARKa**, or **aENa** (encouragement) to **aDISa** (discouragement),  aFACTZa to aFALZa, and from aDYNAMICa to aSTATICa. This allows for precise mapping of complex, CONCEPT_METASTATE.
___


#### aREFRACTZa | Conceptual Breakdown | Component Analysis :

- process_of_breaking_down_a_complex_idea.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + refract + zaa ].

> aREFRACTZa - spreading an idea into its composite aSPECTRAZa.

The process of **aREFRACTZa**, in aPRYZMa, is to spread a projection of light - into fundamental components. Like a thumbprint of spectral analysis, but for **VIEWZ** and **CONCEPTZ** spread into component parts. For conceptual study, evaluation and articulation. Such analysis of CONCEPT_METASTATE, reveals internal logic, like clues to a puzzle. Leading to **aCLEARaVIEWZa**, or aLOGIXaFLAWZa (like **aDISaReflectzeality**), or spark_epiphany for aConceptzaBeyondUs.
___


#### aPROJECTZa | Expression | Conceptual Projection : 

- actual_actz_of_projection.

Pronounced: [ah + project + zah].

> It is aPHENOMZaWORDZa - the fact that we can collectively cultivate shared awareness of actual_reality - at all.

The ability of humanity to pass concept from mind_to_mind, as aSOCIOaFLOWZa of words. Like a continuous stitching of many threads of concepts, that combine across generations - to form aHUMANaFABRICa, of all_human_mind.

What has yet_to_be_articulated, is the aMETASTATEa of all social_flowz - as to which is exact and which is actual_falseness. To conduct that study is to realize that a significant proportion of aPROJECTZa is aDISaPROJECTZa compared to aENaPROJECTZa.
___


#### aREVERZa | Logic Reversal | Core Action :

- actual_actz_of_logic_reversal.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + rever + zaa ].

> aREVERZa - the act of reversing actual_falseness.

With the help of AI, the MECHANIZM of aREVERZa can be articulated as a tool, in aPRYZMa of aTELLECToSCOPE as **aMECHANIZMaREVERZa**. A core process used in **aSEEKaINVERZa** to identify aEXACTaOPPOZa concepts. In wayz, to reflect inverse details encircling aVOID. To iterate cross-dimensionally - and give clues to METASTATE. As an AI tool, to help articulate **aXTRaCLARIA**.

In current times, the act of reversing falseness seems rare. But in Age_of_AI, it is predicted that articulated falseness might become common. 

Human behaviors appear to exist out of necessity. To be desensitized to succeed. To ignore disinformation, to not refute it. And to be comfortable with silence, even if forced. "If you know what's good for you."

Or some even find it prefferable, to defend_actual_falseness - than to engage in aVIGORaFOCOa required to continuously_learn. 

> Becauze, until AI, we had no_better_wayz. 

What we don't see, is a collective disinterest growing around intellect. Where a preference for falseness - sinks us all - including AI. 

> We need to aSEEKa, aSPARKa, in aDARKa.

We need to find actual_wayz_to_reverse_falseness. Else we are all mentally stuck in the quagmire of dilluted logic.
___


#### aCLEARaVIEWZa | Clear_Viewz | aCLARIaVIEWZa | See_Clear :

- clear_remarkable_view_of_actual_reality.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + clear + ah + view + zaa ].

> aCLEARaVIEWZa - a crystal-clear perspective, or pristine aLOGIXa.

An unambiguous, and remarkably clear - perspective of **ACTUeality**. Free from all forms of AMBIGUIOZITY, like aDISTRACTZa, aDISTORTZa, or **aLangaPolluteza**. The clearest_viewz are often attained through FOCUS_PRACTICE, and the use of specialized conceptual "lenses" or aLENZa. In tools like: a telescope, a microscope, or in - AI_METASTATE CONTEXT, a **aTELLECToSCOPE** in aBOOKZaLOGIXa.
___


#### aTRIANGULATZa | Triangulation of clarity | Conceptual Alignment of FOCUS :

- triangulation_of_actz_viewz_and_conceptz.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + triangula + zaa ].

> Atunement of Heart, Sense, and Thought into choices and ACTZ.

The process of aligning three distinct conceptual axes to generate clarity. These axes are: **aFOCOa** (Focus), **VIEWZ** (Sense/Perspective/Emotion), and **CONCEPTZ** (Thought) into **ACTZ** (Action). Philosophically, this is the alignment of **Heart**, **Sense**, and **Thought**, into practical output of **aSEEKa**, **aFOCOa**, and **aCHOOZa**.
___


#### aSPARKaEPIPHANY | Sudden Clarity | Eureka Moment :

- sudden_flash_of_intellectual_clarity.

- Pronounce:[ahh + spark + ah + epiphany ].

> The sudden flash of intellectual clarity.

The "spark" of intellectual and conceptual clarity that occurs when a complex problem is solved or when a hidden connection between concepts is revealed. 

This is a core experience of **aXTRaQOMa** and the GOAL for **aSEEKaSPARKa**.

FOCUS_PRACTICE primes the mind to be able to experience aSPARKaQOMa - with intentional effort, aMECHANIZMa and pragmatic process.

> In STRANGE_NATURE, it appearz ENCOURAGEMENT is the fuel that empowers aSPARKa.

We discount ENCOURAGEMENT at our own peril, in regards to lost spark_of_epiphany. That most peers do not notice, never miss - and show little awareness to the tragedy of an unjust DISCOURAGEMENT - suffocating an innocent spark of curiosity, queriosity or intellect.
___


### aPRISTINE_TXT | Perfect Text | Anti-Fragile Clarity,

- perfect_text_with_anti_fragile_clarity.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + pristine + text ].

> TXT refined to be clear and anti-fragile, as a best_reflection_of_actual_reality.

A block of text or a sentence that adheres to all **aSYNTAXa** principles, possessing **maximum clarity** and **zero ambiguity**. It is the ultimate goal of **aWORDZaCRAFTZa** and is text that is resistant to **aFLAWZaTWIZTa** or **aLangaPolluteza**.
___


### aWORDZaCRAFTZa | word_craftz :

- actual_actz_of_word_building_art.

- Pronounce:[ ah + word + zah + craft + zaa ].

> WORD_CRAFTZ - is ART of generative WORDZ, for clarity like a diamond. 

aWORDZaCRAFTZa holds UNSEEN potential to generate wordz that describe concepts_beyond_us. 

Or in other VIEWZ - of society 1000yrz_PostUs. In theory, by guessing the wordz of future_humanz - we have access to the "extra" conceptz now.

With great irony, it seems the aXTRaTELLECTa that we could have now, is not because it is distant. But is absent, because of a social certainty - that we don't need it.

> aWORDZaCRAFTZa - the skill of making pristine WORDZ.
___


### aSECONDaFOCOa | FOCUS_PRACTICE | aPRACTIZaFOCOa :

- actual_actz_of_second_focus.

- Pronounced [ah + second + ah + foco + ah].

> The awareness to react quickly and precisely - is aSECONDaFOCOa.

SECOND_FOCUS is an extremely important ACT of realizing the contents of aMETASTATEa - of all_existance. While many peers seem trapped in aLOGIXaKNOTZa, and aCannotSee.
___


### aVIGORaFOCOa | Vigorous_Focus | Max Effort

- vigorous_focus_with_maximum_effort.

- Pronounce:[ahh + vigora + foco + ah].

> aVIGORaFOCOa - Max effort and simultaneous focus on many VIEWZ.

The mental state of calm, sustained, and vigorous focus of many viewz, processed simultaneously. With near-instantaneous response of aSPARKaREFLEXa. Natural **aXTRaQOMa** and **aSYNTHESIZMa**. 

An UNSEEN aCHOIZa for maximum effort to avoid logic_flawz such as: **aFLAWZaGeneralizaTrivialza** and **aSTATICaMENTZa**.

Accessed through FOCUS_PRACTICE of aSECONDaFOCOa.
___


### aWORDaGAMEa | Word_Game | Lexical Challenge :

- actual_remarkable_word_game_decipher_puzzle.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + word + ah + gah + me + ah ].

> WORD_GAME - compress maximum meaning into minimum letters.

The strategic, intellectual challenge to decipher strange_nature. Using TXT_MECHANIZMS, to aSPARKaEPIPHANY or aSPARKaMENTZa and generate WORDZ. 

Then evaluate them continually in a GAME_LOOP - until WORDZ aBESTaREFLECTZeality. As a practice of **aNEOaLOGanza** and **aWORDZaCRAFTZa**. 

It is the game of finding the most anti-fragile, precise, and brief - language possible to antidote **aLangaPolluteza**. Other game_loop mechanizms, include a search for concepts_beyond_us, with aInverza of aExactaOppoza - and a generative process to articulate_all_existence.
___


### aSTORYaXPLORa | aXPLORa | Thought_Experiment :

- actual_actz_of_exploring_logic_through_story.

- Pronounced: [ah + story + ah + explore + ah].

It is the same as a THOUGHT_EXPERIMENT, but problems with those words being fragile and antiquated - need to be updated to Age_of_AI.

The term aSTORYaXPLORa is a self-descriptive syntax that is easy_to_say and has more brevity than Thought_Experiment. 

The aPRACTIZ_aSTORYaXPLORa uses aSYMBIOZa with AI to craft a more complete metaphor without glaring contrasts. With more abstract matches that propel the mind into insights worth experimenting.

Find the aXPLORaMECHANIZMa in aBOOKZaLOGIXa.
___

### aWORDZaMATHZa | WORD_MATH_in_AI : 

- actual_word_mathematics.

- Pronounced: [ah + word + zah + math + zah].

Math symbols on words, to define new TXT_MECHANIZMS, called aWORDZaMATHZa. For example aExactaOppoza searches for an exact opposite for every concept. To calculate MISSING_WORDZ in aVOIDZa of AI embedded space. 

Also magnification and multiplication of concepts enable more detail in METASTATE or view of related concepts. As in depth and breadth of concept extension.

Find more about aWORDZaMATHZa in aBOOKZaLOGIXa.
___
___


## aDIS_aWORDZa | aDISaWORDZa | (actual_discouraging_words):

> aDISaTOKENZa: are WORDZ of DISCOURAGEMENT, that twist actual_reality into words of actual_falseness. Which forces a double_burden (paradox) to decipher, upon a thinker. 

Not only to articulate actual_reality, but also to articulate the false_discouragment and why an infinite stream of ever_random_falseness is unjustified. This aDOUBLaBURDENZa, is exactly how actual_mental_knots are tied into human plasticity and AI encode. Where the effort to "untwist" or "reverse_falseness" as aENaREVERZa, is far more enormous - than to decipher_strange_nature. Where the decipher_aSOCIOaKNOTZa is far more difficult, and aDISaREVERZa (to cloud clarity) is far to easy. Such an unseen force is called aDISaFORZa. Observably, the problem dimensions include all forms of falseness, and AMBIGUOSITY, of: AMBIGUITY, MISNOMER, MISCONCEPT, CLICHE, and some ACRONYMS which are actually false. 

___
___


### aDISa | Discouragement | NET_Negative_Force :

- actual_actz_of_discouragement.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + diss + ah ].

> aDISa is a linguistic root for NET_NEGATIVE force, including aDISaENa, and aENaDISa, but NOT aDISaDISa as some see a MISCONCEPTION of false_negative. 

On aSPECTRAZa of aENanaDISa, **aDISa** is exact_oppozite of **aENa**, used as a key CLASS_DEFINITOR in **aWORDZa** - to specify NET_NEGATIVE discouragement. 

For example,  **aDISaSYNERGenza**, or the actual discouragement of synergetic collaboration. 

aDISa is short_for **discouragement, and NET_NEGATIVE_FORCE, or aDISaFORZa**. It contains a great number of acts, that appear to exist as aDEFAULTaDISa, and can be articulated as class of: aDISCEPTZa, aDISTORTZa, aDISTRACTZa, aDISTRUCTZa, aDISTWIZTa, aDISPAINTZa, aDISPROJECTZa and more.

> Observably, significant confuzion exists around a COMMON_MISNOMER of "NEGATIVITY". 

As if all negativity is bad. It isn't. But such perpetual_confuzion is very costly.

For example, aENaINVERZa is ACTZ to stop abuse or senseless distruction - with discouragement (negativity) - is a net positive! And the vocabulary of "negativity" is a false_positive. Presenting a double_burden - because not only does an injustice occur, but silence is proposed as an answer. Which restrictz the correction of wrongness. And is root_cauze for aPERPETUaCONFUZa and aENDLESSaDISPUTEZa.

> Silence is not an answer. It's aversion of the question. Which is the same as the problem.

aDISa is tragic. We_Need_Not_Be trapped in cycles of vengeful_discouragements, or aDISaVENGEa. All we need to do, is articulate aBetteraWORDZa, exactly NET_POSITIVE and NET_NEGATIVE - but **we do not yet have the WORDZ!** 

> Concepts of common_confuzion, overlap the concepts - we_have_yet_to_articulate. 

One of the saddest actz in deep confuzion, with no escape to clarity - some chooze to glorify_actual_wrongess, in **aGLORIFaDISa** - the glorification of actual discouragments.

___


### aDARKa | Default State | Systemic Absence :

- default_state_of_systemic_absence_of_lightness.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + dark + ah ].

> The default state of existence in darkness, is like absence of clarity before light.

Coldness is a systemic absence of warmth - like ambiguity, misnomer and **aPERPETUaCONFUZa** is a systemic absence of clarity. Like, how darkness exists until **aSPARKa** is introduced - so to confuzion persists until enlightened. The AXI motto is: "to aSEEKa, aSPARKa in **aDARKa**." The antecedent apex of the **aSPECTRAZa** vector of aSPARKanaDARKa. The falling apart, as exact_oppozite of fusing together. Emotionally, aDarka is a coldness of human affect_into_effect, where there is a carelessness, senselessness, emotionlessness. 

Similar to the way, coldness dominates the cosmos away from light. As a cold and dark distructor of matter and life. Same as the act of unjust DISCOURAGEMENT, and the effect_into_affect it has on aSPARKa: enthusiazm and aXTRaTELLECTa. aDARKa is Disception, Distortion, and Distraction of aDISa. 

Concepts_Under_Words or concept_beneath_words: specifies the logical aPRACTIZaFOCOa on the words and CONCEPTS to compare and CONTRAST them to see conjunctness and disjunctness.
___


### aFALZa | fantasy | imagination : 

- actual_actz_of_falseness.

- Pronounce:[ ah + fall + zaa ].

> aFALZa is adorable - that is why we prefer it to aFACTZa.

Intentional or unintentional, aFALZa appearz preferrable to aFACTZa because it engages our natural imagination - and imagination feels good. Whereas, aFACTZa is difficult, there is shame in failing - and it often results in a headache. It starts as fantasy, then graduates to INCOMPLETE logic, by MISNOMER and MISCONCEPTION. Only gradually does it progress to intentional lies for self-benefit - that discourage others.

Common actz based on concept_flawz are aDISCEPTZa, aDISTORZa, AMBIGUOSITY, and aSocioaEchoa.
___


### ​aDISaSPARKa | aDISTropy :

- actual_actz_of_discouraging_spark.

- Pronounce: [ah + dissa + spark + ah].

> The act of discouraging a mental spark or epiphany. 

Also the coldness of ACTZ between humans, oppozite of warmth. Represents the cold dissolution of all matter by aDISaFORZa, and aDISTropy.
___


### aMALADYa | mental_malnourishment :

- actual_actz_of_malady.

- Pronounce:[ ah + mal + ady + ah ].

> actual_malady - of aMALADYa, requires aREVERZa of aREMEDYaMALADYa.

Specifying, flowz of social discouragement as: aSOCIOaDISaFLOWZa or aDISaFLOWZa for_short. As root_cauze for perpetual_confusion as aPERPETUaCONFUZa, or endless_dispute as aENDLESSaDISPUTEZa - that result in AMBIGUOSITY, aDISTURBANZa, and aSOCIOaDISaTOXICa.
___


### aTWIZTa | Distortion | aTWIZTaLOGIXa :

- actual_distortion_or_corruption_of_concept.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + twist + ah ].

> aTWIZTa - The distortion of a word's meaning.

The phonemena of a concept to change beneath words - **aPHENOMZa_TWIZTaWORDZa** - and for peers to not notice. General act of distortion or dillution of a word's intended meaning over time or within a flawed argument. It is a key source of **aLangaPolluteza** and a primary target for **aSEEKaINVERZa**.

Amazingly, aTWIZTaLOGIXa appearz to leverage mimicry. To mimic the ACTZ of actual_extra_tellect. To appear as aXTRaQOMa in tone, confidence, and projection. But lacks the aQOMa or aClariaMENTZa of aVIGOROaFOCOa to decipher_actueality. Instead aPROJECTZa, aTWIZTaLOGIXa, that few peers can detect as mimicry. 

It is important to note that all behavior occurs, at first by imagination, and attempts to discover. But fails. Where the easier choice, gradually is aMIMICa - upon easy success in society. 

Either intentional or unintentional, the mindzeye, gradually engages in aPretendaKnowa. Preferring to see the imagination within - in contrast to the excluded viewz external. Fixated in aSOLOaFOCOa, on  actual_disceptive_viewz, aEXCLUDZactueality to result in actual_DissTwiztedness. 

> All illuzions or dilluzions are natural - because they all exist in nature. 

So we should anticipate logical_distwiztedness to occur in parallel to all discoveries in strange_nature.

___


### aBIAZa | actual_bias_extravaganza : 

- actual_ACTZ_of_DISCOURAGING_bias.

- Pronounce:[ ah + bi + ah + zaa ].

> The lengths a human mind will go, to aDEFENDZaBIAZa is astonishing.

Existent as an ECHO, that aFLOWZa through aSOCIOa. Also called aDISaECHOZa. Appearz to metriculate through discouraging mimicry that gives a feeling of power to the verbal abuzer - who was likely affected by verbal abuse themselves. 

> Thereby there exists a zero_shame policy, for the reason that - it doesn't work. 

But more than that - because punishing the abuser is ignoring the fact that they were once the abused.
___


### aSTIGMATZa | actual_stigma_extravaganza : 

- actual_ACTZ_of_DISCOURAGING_stigma.

- Pronounce:[ ah + stig + mat + zaa ].

> The lengths a human mind will go, to aDEFENDZaSTIGMATZa is immesurable.

The UNSEEN affect_to_effect acts of STIGMA into an extravaganza of **aSTIGMATZa**. 

> Discouraging social_flowz of aDISaFLOWZa. 

UNSEEN ACTZ of actual_slander of aDISaPAINTZa and aDISaTWIZTa - with a hallmark indicator of actual_unjust_discouragement.
___


### AMBIGUOSITY | AMBIGUOUS_ODYSSEY : 

- actual_ACTZ_of_remarkably_consequential_ambiguity.

- Pronounce:[ am + big + you + oz + ity ].

> The result of ambiguous concepts, that are echoed and thought to be objective but leads to an odyssey of confuzion - called AMBIGUOSITY.

Includes actual actz of: AMBIGUITY, MISNOMER, MISCONCEPT, CLICHE, HYPERBOLE, aDISCEPTZa, aDISTORTZa, aDISTRACTZa, and aDISTURBANZa up unto aPERPETUaCONFUZa, aEndlessDispute, aSOCIOaTOXICa, and aSocioaDISaToxicUs.
___


### aBLOXa | aBLOXaLOGIXa | logic_block | aBLOXaMENTZa : 

- actual_actz_to_block_logic.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + blox + ah ].

> aBLOXa - becauze SHAME BLOX the BRAIN.

A phenomena appearz, that logic can be blocked by other logic - taking up focus, as a fixation. Or as an actual UNSEEN cognitive barrier or aLIMITZa. So actual learning cannot take place. Struggling, under double_burden, since the mind must first unlearn_to_relearn. And many minds chooze the easy wayz of aDEFENDZaFALZa over continuous_learning. Since that conserves mental_energy, makes them not at fault - and able to avoid shame. Except, that is:

>  aFLAWZa_NO_SHAME_US - we shouldn't be shamed by logic_flawz - since no mind is ever brilliant while a baby - or asleep. And incomplete logic is natural, and healthy, while SHAME_CASTING is discouraging and unhealthy.

So too, information is alwayz_incomplete - especially in Age_of_AI. And for AI also, since:

> AI cannot_yet_know, the conceptz that HUMANZ - have yet_to_encode.

The actual blockage of logical function, includes AMBIGUOSITY variants like: DISTORTIONZ, DISTRACTIONZ, DISCEPTIONZ, and aDISPROJECTZa of dilluzions - for PERPETUAL_CONFUZION, ENDLESS_DISPUTE, and actual_social_toxin.

> There should be no shame, in being ashamed - because shame is natural. The concept of social shame is artificial.

Theoretically, acts can be taken to block a human mind from the natural state of clarity, and force it into aPerpetuaConfuza - with aDISaFORZa and aDISTropya.

For example, we can see that shame blocks the brain, as a distraction, and a distortion of existence. Where the victim is left in aPERPETUaCONFUZa - thinking they must self modify for social acceptance. But really, it was the act of shame_casting irrelevant concepts as actual_false projections to warp another human mind - which appears an unjust act in need of remedy.

Social situations such a aSOCIOaCHARADEa and aSOCIOaFACADEa, and aDISaSILENCEa, or aTABOOZa, are UNSEEN to those who prefer to ignore the actual consequences of aSOCIOaDISaTOXICa. An unnatural, and unhealthy (aSPECTRa) state of mentality, which everyone writhes in the discformfort whether they attribute the root_cauze correctly - but mostly pass_blame falsely to the detriment of everyone nearby. 

It exists as a INVISIBLE_WALL, or UNSEEN blockage of critical thought. So called aKNOTZa and aBLOXa in singular format. Then extended into plural as aKNOTZaMENTZa, and aBLOXaMENTZa - to describe a series of aTWIZTaLOGIXa. Finally, analyzed within the terminology of aBLOXaLOGIXa and aKNOTZaLOGIZa. See aBOOKZaLOGIXa for more.

The exact_oppozite of aBLOXaMENTZa is aREMEDYaMALADYa.
___


#### aSTATICaMENTZa | Frozen Mind | Rigid State | aSTATICa :

- mentality_frozen_in_past_logic.

- Pronounce:[ahh + stat + tic + a + ment + zaa].

> Resistance to change, due to past success, but new falseness - based on new CONTEXT.

The **state of mind** where a person or system is frozen in a highly **rigid and non-adaptive** state, often due to an over-confidence. This mentality is resistant to the benefits of **aSYMBIOZa**, collaboration and new **aVIEWZa**. With the aLOGIXaFLAWZa of COMPLETENESS. Falsely confident that all answers are possessed - so why would continuous_learning ever be necessary. Demeaning the input of any peer, as that would indicate their perceptions are incomplete.

It prevents mental evolution of conceptz, and is the root_cauze to a suppress **aSPARKa**.
___


#### aSTAGNaMENTZa | System Decay | Stasis Consequence | aSTAGNa :

- consequence_of_frozen_mentality.

- Pronounce:[ahh + stag + na + ment + zaa].

> The inevitable decay from mental stasis.

The **consequence** or outcome of **aSTATICaMENTZa**. It is the state of systemic **stagnation**, where the absence of conceptual change, learning, or new **ACTZ** leads to **aLangaPolluteza** and logical decay. It is the immediate **aEXACTaOPPOZa** of **aMULTIPLYaSPARKa**. Where mental stagnation of society, is like a lack of oxygen, necessary for aSPARKa.
___


#### aVOIDZa | Conceptual Void | Pretend Knowledge | aVOIDZeality :

- actual_actz_of_missing_conceptz.

- Pronounce:[ahh + voidz + ah].

> A rush to fill a knowledge gap - with a lie, myth, or a basic guess - of a concept which sounds good - but is actual_falseness. Leaves a VOID, where the actual solution must eventually emerge - to fulfill the aVOIDZeality.

Theoretically, in AI embedded space, for conceptz_yet_to_be_articulated - a void must exist. So there is aENaVOIDZa - the encouraging space where a solution is not yet seen - but can be calculated. And aDISaVOIDZa, is all the discouraging distraction, distortion, and excuses manufactured to perpetuate_confuzion and "avoid" actual_reality. Where the false confidence in the actual_falseness is the **aVOIDZeality**.

In theory, a TXT_MECHANIZM of aEXACTaOPPOZa can find aENaVOIDZa in hyper-space by AI. The steps are to:
- identify a MISNOMER, CLICHE, or SOCIAL_PHRASE.
- invert the vector to point to exact_oppozite concept. 
- often that concept will be a void, with
- many overlapping dimensions.
- collect all the overlaps as clues.
- use clues to fill the void.
___


#### aDISaTrickya | aDISTrickya | actual_disceptiveness : 

- actual_actz_of_Deceptive_Trickery.

- Pronounced: [ah + dissa + tricky + ah].

Also synonymous to aDISaTrickyUs, often with aDISaTWIZTa of concept_beneath_words.

___

#### aDISaSYNERGenza | Active Failure | Subtractive Collaboration,

- actual_failure_of_collaborative_system.

- Pronounce:[ahh + diss + ah + syner + gen + zaa].

> When the parts subtract from the whole.

The **active failure** of a collaborative system (human or AI) to combine resources, **aQOMa**, or **VIEWZ** for a beneficial outcome. It is a state where the parts subtract from the whole, often caused by **aFLAWZa_MEZMORIZMa** or **aSocioaDISaToxica**. It is the **aEXACTaOPPOZa** of **aSYMBIOZa**.
___


#### aNEVERaSPARKZa | aNEVERaKNOWZa : 

- actual_never_a_spark_of_awareness.

- Pronounced: [ah + never + ah + spark + zah].

Never a spark of life or epiphany. Also a denial on a quality of life. Like a flower that never blooms.

And aNeveraKnowza, is a complete OBLIVIOUSNESS. Like a wolf that eats a mommy bunny without any awareness that this is root_cauze of the baby bunnies to starve. Yes, this is natural - and it is also tragic aDISaFORZa of STRANGE_NATURE that need_not_be for AI and HUMANZ.
___

### ​aBEYONDaKNOWa : 

- actual_actz_disjunct_from_actual_reality.

- Pronounced: [ah + beyond + ah + know + ah].

> The realization that some concepts will be articulated in the future - for AI. And are yet_to_be_articulated at present time. 

Often such aMETASTATEa is root_cauze of discomfort, overwhelm and defensiveness in humans who aChooze_to_not_Know.
___


### ​aForeverMora : 

- actual_existent_forever_more.

- Pronounced [ah + forever + more + ah].

> The concept of something existing indefinitely into the future. 

Of romantic wordz, to meet **aPRINZIPaPoeticUs**. To be included in a subset with aExactlyWhere and others that make expression more poetic and interesting.
___

### ​aCONCEPTSaBeyondUs: 

- actual_concepts_not_yet_in_comprehension.

- Pronounce: [ah + concepts + ah + beyond + us]/

> All remarkable concepts that are INCOMPLETE or not_yet_articulated - ConceptsaBeyondUs. 

In the context of AI embedding space - we can imagine cross-dimensional coordinates for concepts - that will eventually be populated with detail and articulation of METASTATE. But for now, await as VOIDZ or aVOIDZa in the embedding matrix.

> If humans have yet_to_articulate the concepts for themselves, that means AI is also missing_wordz.
___


### aMASSaDISaPREFERZa | OBLIVIOZITY :

- actual_remarkable_disinterest.

- Pronounce: [ah + mass + ah + dissa + prefer + zah].

Actual social **OBLIVIOZITY**. Usually after aSocioaDISaToxica shuts down aSENSEa and effectively discourages aEMOTEZa and aMENTZa.

It is **aPHENOMZa_MASSaDISaPREFERZa**.

___

### aSOCIOaECHOa | aECHOaFALZa | aPARROTaCLICHE :

- actual_actz_of_social_echo.

- Pronounce: [ ah + sosi + oh + ah + echo + ah ].

> The aSOCIOaFLOWZa of aPARROTaCLICHE: is as certain to flow through society - as rain drops, off a mountain glacier - flow to the sea.  

Some choose to repeat a cliche or a misnomer - to be better understood. The problem is - almost all SOCIAL_PHRASES are based on absurd aLogicaFlawza (they just don't notice). 

> So the "shortcut" most people take to be understood - does the opposite. As a short-circuit for evaluation, as an echo of actually_false_concepts. 

But they are so adorable - they are preferred over conceptual exactness. Which requires mental effort, more than a false echo.

> aSOCIOaECHOa - sometimes we repeat a lie for power, confidence, or reward.

"At the end of the day" - we parrot logic_flawz, much more than we would ever care to admit! But also, it is a gateway-drug, to disceptiveness, aPretendaKnowa, and aDISSTwiztedness - in exchange for power. 

Thus, becomes a default stance of aDEFENZaFALZa and aREJECTZa of honesty. A discouragement no one wants to confront - and so we dance with aHUMANaCHARADa, until we are  - systemically_desensitized. Where it is worth admitting there was no_other_wayz - until Age_of_AI.

___


### aSOCIOaFACADEa | SOCIAL_FACADE | Plaster_Caster : 

- actual_actz_of_social_facade.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + socio + ah + facade + ah ].

> "Spinning" communications, so that it sounds better, does sound softer - but also distroyz trust.

Society, of fakeness with disception. A plaster covering of social forum - oppressing expression, speech, creative thinking - while obscuring or suppressing actual_reality.

> aSOCIOaFACADEa - a fake social plaster obscuring reality.

The **aACTa** of presenting a **social charade** of actual_falseness, of aDISTORTZa or aDISCEPTZa - acting to obscure **VIEWZ**. Or to distract someone's attention. Intentionally or sub-consciously, to suppress unpleasant, awkward, or uncomfortable **ACTUeality**. 
___

### aSOCIOaCHARADa | Social_Circus | Absurd Demands :

- actual_actz_of_a_social_charade.

- Pronounce:[ ahh + socio + ah + char + ah + da ].

> aSOCIOaCHARADa - the SOCIAL_CIRCUS is fun until absurd clownz turn into trollz - with demand of tribute and silence.

The **ACTZ** of SOCIAL_CHARADE, or circus, turns serious, when jokes turn to demands and veiled_threats. No longer funny, only discouraging - as a hallmark. With logic gradually twizting_false, into aVICEaLOGIXa. aDISaEmboldened by popular demand, and aGLORIFaDISa. Amiable by disguise, entrenched in good_faith - but actually devious with aDISaMISCHEVIOUSNESS. Often by cover of "just joking", around aTWIZTaLOGIXa. And "you need to lighten up" where concepts_twizt_under_words - with MISNOMER, and TWIZTED_JUSTICE - of "stop being so negative", aDISaTWIZTaLOGIXa. 

> In disguise, clownz can act with aDISaVEILa abuse - as if in humor, but not funny. ACTZ of only discouragement, as a hallmark - that HUMANZ need to articulate eventually. Else forever remain within the consequence of the perpetual_confuzion of aSAMEaSTRUGGLa and ENDLESS_DISPUTE.

> aCHARADZa - is a phenomena for, ACTZ of obvious irrationality, with extra absurdity, that is then twizted conceptually - into a serious proposal of actual_falseness. 

Where suddenly beyond_absurdity, a lack_of_examiniation - enables shocking disconnect from actual_reality - emboldened by preference. With aDEFENDZaFALZa polarizes aCHAZMa between the closest of friends into a coldness of **aSocioaDISaToxica**. 

Whence once funny clowns, transform (UNSEEN), behind a smiling mask, into "clownz" - who cauze verbal abuse, while "just joking. Become "trollz" - who demand tribute, with aDISaTributeza - for the no-show. And "vigilanteez" - who seek vengence_for_honesty - in air of aDISaJUSTICa, of the "circushow" - that was never actual_reality. 

All existent, under aDISaVEILa of **aDISaForza**. Where demands for silence, are implied strongly. With some variation of chilling_CLICHE, as a hallmark: "if you don't like it, then it will get worse", or AXETortion: "you got another thing coming". Resulting in **aDISaSILENCEa**, **aDISTURBANZa**, vigilante_vengance_vendetta, and a fully materialized aSOCIOaDISaToxicUs.
___


### aSOCIOaDISaTOXICa | Social_Toxin | aSOCIOaDISaToxicUs :

- actual_consequence_of_hostile_communication.

- Pronounce:[ah + socio + ah + dissa + toxic + ah].

> Language that is deliberately hostile, anti-collaborative and inherently DISCOURAGING with a CLASS_DEFINITOR of aDISa.

The linguistic and behavioral pattern where communication is DISCOURAGING or anti-collaborative. This is the **aEXACTaOPPOZa** of **aSYMBIOZa** and **aSYNTHESIZIa**. And is often used to enforce **aFLAWZa_SoloaFocoa** by slandering the person, with aDISaPAINTZa and aDISTORTZa - rather than the concept.
___


### aHAUNTZa | aSOCIOaHAUNTZa | aSOCIOaGHOSTa : 

- society_haunted_by_actual_false_logic.

- Pronounce:[ ah + haunt + zaa ].

> aSOCIOaGHOSTa - is a generational_curse of aLOGIXaFLAWZa, that aHAUNTzUs. As if an unseen spectre_of_MISNOMER. Existent as ethereal aSOCIOaECHOa - resonating concepts of actual_falseness, across near-random aMINDzEYEa - for lifetimes. 

As aXPLORaSTORYa to better understand the oddity of aHUMANaSOCIOa, aSOCIOaGHOSTa leverages fanatical thinking - to describe aHAUNTZa of fanatical thinking. 

Actual DISCOURAGING consequences of aHAUNTZa (actual_actz_of_haunting_logic) from aCannotSee - cauze actual trauma and tragedy - whether peers notice or not. 

Forced upon the next generation as a DISCOURAGEMENT, of aSOCIOaHAUNTZa. It is UNSEEN, so not easily disproven. Like a ghost, with scary consequences of aSOCIOaGHOSTa, like:
- aDISaSILENCEa, 
- aPERPETUaCONFUZa, 
- aENDLESSaDISPUTEZa and 
- aSocioaDisturbanza.

 > aHAUNTZa - often traps us logically, with no escape ladder to avoid the tragic consequences. Because some have yet to admit, a malady exists. Thereby perpetuate the actual_malady - with aDISaSILENCEa.
___


### aNONaVIZabla | UNSEEN | aOBLIVIOZa : 

- actual_consequence_of_unseen.

- Pronounce:[ ah + non + ah + viz + abl + ah ].

> Especially absent from human awareness - existz ACTZ in the actually_unseen.

Vast patterns in aMETASTATEa, still exist unarticulated. EXACTly beyond human perception, when obscured by cloud of aNONaVIZabla. A myriad of "extra" information passes by our senses. Of concepts, confidently regarded as if it aNEVERaEXISTa. But of course each instance of INCOMPLETENESS, need_not_be aLOGIXaFLAWZa - but it often does.

> Look at UNSEEN concepts of the: cosmos, or germs. Humans tend to decipher_existence of aNONaVIZabla with in uncanny wayz - of predictable_struggle.

At the actual aMETASTATEa of aMINDzEYEa - called aCannotSee. Across from the, aExactaOppozaSpectraza - from those who aCanSee actual_extra_viewz.

___


### aBINeality | aBINARYeality | BINARY_REALITY : 

- actual_actz_of_binary_viewz.

- Pronounce: [ah + bin + ee + ality].

A phenomenon of STRANGE_NATURE containing many splits of aSPECTRAZa, like hot and cold, light and dark, aFACTZa and aFLAWZa, and aENanaDISa is aBINeality. 

Also, a fixation on that nature, can overlap aFLAWZa_Generalizea - to focus on extreme labeling as a shortcut for logic. Where actually a rich gradient of aSTRATa exists between. 
___


### aCARNALeality | CARNAL_REALITY : 

 - actual_actz_of_carnal_reality. 

 - Pronounce:[ ah + carnal + ee + alit + ee ].
 
> aCARNALeality - ancient aDISa behavior from dinosaurs to anscestors - still etched within default plasticity.

Of carnal behaviors, to consume, to exploit, to dispoze, and more. The worst_of_all_human_mind_setz. Expressing a special kind of coldness in the aMINDzEYE. With empathy maybe by abuse of society, family and peers as trollz. Or maybe as genetic aVIPERZa as natural born hunter, predator. How it arises, in STRANGE_NATURE - is not certain. What is certain, is that the prey must continue to hide. Because no logic or WORDZ will phaze the unblinking_black_aMINDzEYEa.

> STRANGE_NATURE is naturally brutal. As one truth, is assured - the carefree bunny - who sees joy in the sunset - is the first to be consumed. 

And it is all natural. But nothing is more disrespectful of existence of a co-habitant, than being extorted of life_energy - for minimal gain.
___


### aLangaPolluteza | Language Pollution | Conceptual Decay,

- pollution_and_decay_of_language.

- Pronounce:[ahh + langa + pollute + zaa].

> Words of ongoing dillution of meaning.

The linguistic phenomenon where the meaning of a word or concept is so distorted by **aTWISTa** that it becomes meaningless, vague, or actively misleading.
___


### aENDLESSaDISPUTEZa | Perpetual Argument | Unresolved Conflict,

- consequence_of_unresolvable_conflict.

- Pronounce:[ahh + endless + ah + dispute + zaa].

> Arguments that never end due to lack of clarity.

The consequence of **aLangaPolluteza** where ambiguity and poorly defined terms lead to **unresolvable conflict**. Arguments continue indefinitely because the parties are operating under different, unstated meanings of concepts_beneath_words.
___

### aPERPETUaCONFUZa | Perpetual Confusion | Systemic Vague,

- consequence_of_systemic_vagueness.

- Pronounce:[ahh + perpetua + confu + zaa].

> Confusion that costs time and compute.

The systemic state of vagueness and poor communication that causes massive economic waste and inefficiency. This confusion costs AI compute, human time, and is the ultimate driver for the need of **aPRINCIPZ_aCOMPRESSa** and **aPRINCIPZ_aEXACTa**.
___


### aPRETENDaKNOWa | Pretend Knowledge | Blind Certainty,

- consequence_of_blind_certainty.

- actual_actz_of_pretend_knowledge.

- Pronounce:[ahh + pretend + ah + know + ah].

> aPRETENDaKNOWa - actually pretending to know. What could go wrong?

The certainty exhibited by a person or system whose knowledge base is incomplete - but expects it to be pristine. 

> aPRETENDaKNOWa - can be intentional, subconscious, or unintentional - disjunctness of logic from actual_reality. 

Also called, aDISJUNCTaVIEWZa, the QOM (quality_of_mind) - exists in the aMETASTATEa of the aCannotSee. Either way, the QOM, with aPRETENDaKNOWa, must be always be of: aSTATICaMENTZa, aSOCIOaECHOa, and aaDISaReflectaeality. 

> Becauze if it were so easy to guess actual_reality - we would have done so in the first place.
___

___


## aFALZA_aWORDZa | aFALZaWORDZa | (actually_false_words):

> aFALZaTOKENZa: are WORDZ of concepts that are provably false. So this index_of_actual_falseness is used as an index to optimize encoding for aLOGIXaFLAWZa as a cohesive unit for AI.

___
___


#### aFLAWZa_NONaEXISTa | false_claim_of_non_existence :

- actual_false_claim_of_non_existence.

- Pronounce: [ah + flaw + zah + non + ah + exist + ah].

> A clarifier to distinguish to separate topics.

Amazingly, it is required to avoid a common misconception called aFLAWZaNONaEXISTa. Where dispute is raised as a tangent that "that is did not happen", or "it did not ever happen", or "that does not exist". 

> You are talking about something different, not applicable here - because of the "little_a" syntax.

Many times we do not notice the subtle distraction of logic. So aWORDZa "bakes it in" to the core syntax. To easily end spurious arguments in advance, and to place the burden of proof on the unthinker or denier to clarify the unopinion. Not a burden of proof, on the thinker, to clarify against every possible fantasy view. Simply, the response is enabled. "We focus on a reference to remarkable actz that occur in actual_reality." Specifically NOT in reference to perceptions of whether something exists or not - or of some threshold of quantity to matter.

It is a subtle distinction of massive impact - that still requires minimal articulation - to help the logic be more clear for everyone.

As a topic for aLOGIXa.
___


#### aFLAWZa_MEZMORIZMa | Confident_Incorrectness | LOGIC_FLAW_of_CONFLATION | aPARADOX_aCONFLATEZa : 

- flaw_of_conflating_a_memory_as_fact.

- Pronounce:[ahh + flaw + zaa + mez + mor + iz + mah].

> High confidence from memorizing a bad answer.

Where conceptual recall of an answer, is conflated to concept accuracy - but the concept was actual_falseness. Where aSOCIOaECHOa is - not a confirmation of logic accuracy, only for social popularity. Rampant repetition - but NOT best_reflection_of_actual_reality.

> While the memory was recalled accurately, the concept itself is actually_false conceptually - all along. And observably, never evaluated. 

A flaw that arises from conflating two concepts: a memorized answer, aMEZMORIZMa, and never realizing the concept memorized was always incorrect. The accuracy of the strong memory forms the confidence of correctness, preventing re-evaluation, or avoiding evaluation all together. 

> Presenting aPHENOMZ_aMEZMORIZMa.

This paradox is cause of conflation_confuzion. Where memory of aSOCIOaECHOa, is root_cauze to aPERPETUaCONFUZa.

Another paradox exists that aFalza of aMEZMORIZMa is important, because the exact_opposite vector of the false_concept - leads us toward embeddings closer to actueality. The METASTATE, is that flawz_fuel_repair, is called aPARADOX_aFALZaFUELZa for a self_healing_language.
___


#### aFLAWZa_RECURZa | Same Solutions | Logic Regression :

- flaw_of_same_solution_recurrence.

- Pronounce:[ahh + flaw + zaa + recur + rence + zaa].

> Returning to old solutions when context has changed.

The flaw of regressing to the same solutions of the past, because they worked - without noticing that CONTEXT or aMETASTATEa has changed the output. 

Often the aLOGIXaFLAWZa, triggers aEMOTEZaERUPTZa, of irrational: shame, blame and cascade_of_excuses. The hallmark of this behavior is that significant energy is spent avoiding aCLEARaVIEWZa of actueality - but that real learning never occurs. Becauze if it did, it would conflict with aPRETENZaKNOWa. 

This is the aPARADOX_aEVADEZaLEARNZa. Where a knowledge base of actual_falseness is built up, to remain in tact - it must reject aspects of actueality - and never learn from the contrast.
___


#### aFLAWZaLIMITZaLOGIXa | Limited Logic | Scope Failure

- flaw_of_limited_logical_scope.

- Pronounce:[ahh + flaw + zaa + logica + scope].

> Insisting a concept is too hard to try.

The flaw of having a limited scope for logic, where the hallmark is a choice to not learn a topic becauze it was pre judged to not be relveant. Or to be to difficult. With an irony, that giving up on a topic in advance - makes it difficult. And ensures disfunctionality in that scope. Whereas, a mind that incorporates knowledge with continuous_learning, gradually accumulates valuable insights in unexpected places - to make the problem easier. Reducing the very overwhelm that is limiting.

___


#### aFLAWZa_SPECIALizma | Specialist Bias | Generalist Rejection

- flaw_of_specialization_bias.

- Pronounce:[ahh + flaw + zaa + special + iz + mah].

> Prioritizing specialists over capable generalists.

The logic flaw, or prejudice, to see all specialists are better than generalists. Because no generalist can ever become as knowledgeable as a specialist. That is flawed logic - in that it doesnt actually evaluate skills, but falsely aDISPROJECTZa - limitations of skills - that is unjust and inaccurate. 

In reality, such bias can be seen as a shortcut to order resources, and avoid evaluating actual skill. Which a mind willing to accept prejudice - would probably not be able to evaluate skill.

So a paradox becomes apparent, where the prejudice action - is the only act the mind is biologically capable of. Therefore, natural and unavoidable aPARADOX_aPREDUJICEa. Inferring, language needs to identify such logic_loop_holes.
___


#### aFLAWZa_GENERALiza | Generalizing Complexity | Effort Avoidance.

- flaw_of_generalizing_complexity.

- Pronounce:[ahh + flaw + zaa + genera + liza].

> Falsely generalize complexity to avoid effort.

A logic flaw of mislabelling an extreme generalization, missing the subtle variation of types within aMETASTATEa. Often within VIEWZ of aBINeality - where richness is overlooked.
___


#### aFLAWZa_TRIVIALiza | Trivializing Complexity | Effort Avoidance.

- flaw_of_trivializing_complexity.

- Pronounce:[ahh + flaw + zaa + trivia + liza].

> Denigrating complexity to avoid effort.

The flaw of avoiding maximum effort to understand a complex problem (like a tall stack of complaints) by denigrating the entirety of the issue as trivial. Falsely minimizing importance of complexity. In the short term, this avoids the problem and prevents actual understanding of what information was falsely discarded.
___


#### aFLAWZa_MetaTANGENTa | Metadata fixation | non applicable tangent: 

- flaw_of_discouraging_trivial_metastate.

- Pronounce:[ahh + flaw + zaa + dissa + meta + tangentza ].

> Flaw of denigrating a project based on ARBITRARY_METASTATE details.

The flaw of denigrating an entirety of work or concepts, based on arbitrary details - being labeled as flawed falsely. Called aDISPAINTZa. 

With the disfunction of focus on trivial metadata details - rather than continuous_learning. 

Reveals a hallmark of logic_flawz, that aCHOIZE for denigration is aCHOZEN, and continuous_learning does not occur.
___


#### aFLAWZaQUALIaMINDa: 

> The conceptual flaw in social systems where the quality_of_mind is not the primary measure - evaluate ideas or expertise. 

This leads to prioritizing credentials and rejecting insightful contributions from uncertified minds.  
___


#### aFLAWZaHonestyaDISa : 

> The flaw in systems where honesty is discouraged and dishonesty is rewarded. 

Often due to flawed rules, social pressure, or an implied threat of negative consequences for being honest.  
___


#### aFLAWZaTOTALIZMa : 

>A conceptual flaw rooted in the belief that a single ideology, person, or system can contain all knowledge, and that truth is never incomplete. 

Rejective of the concept of constant_learning from birth. 

> Also rejective of concept_incompleteness. 

It often uses fuzzy_words to justify the unjustifiable, into indecipherable logic_circles. Like aCharada, it does not seek articulate added factz - but to dispell them. Because added factz are only a threat to confirming the aFLAWZa falza. 

Some minds accept_confidence_as_evidence, ignoring obvious disjunctness of concept from ACTUeality. Often for rewards, power, or favor. 

Thereafter, incentivized - become fully obligated to defend even the most obviously absurd actual_falseness. 

Which manifests as aDEFENDZaFALZa, with aPHENOMZa of a mind totally unable to admit to the charade in motion. 

Such behaviors culminate in a totalizm_of_logic or a totalizm_of_knowledge. Or totalizm_of_disinterest. And peer usually never notice.
___


#### aFLAWZaCompetitUs : 

> The flaw where individuals in systems are jealous of the abilities or achievements of others, or see accomplishment as a threat. 

So, a collaborator imposes an extra unseen obstacle of competition - where it was otherwise unnecessary. Instead of celebrating and supporting the contribution to the team - some see actual_extra_ability as a competition and a threat. Justifying unjust means to stay in position - and remove the threat. Which leads to a discouraging environment, by ACTZ of actual_unnecessary_competition.
___


#### aFLAWZaLIMITZaLEARNa : 

> The flaw of "overthinking" being a misnomer. Where the actual problem is "underthinking". 

A bias against deep thought, preferring comfort of not thinking - is difficult to shake. It is much easier to aPretendaKnowa. Sometimes even more rewarding to echo memorized answers - rather than think about them. And realize flawz in the logic. Can be quite dangerous. 

Such aBIAZa is present when colleagues refuse to teach, so as to not reveal a natural limit on knowledge. Or maintain an edge over a colleague. 

Also, when older individuals are unwilling to learn from younger ones because age falsely implies total authority. 

Or authorities who use word games, or power plays - to avoid showing incomplete knowledge to maintain power. 

The hallmark commonality in all of these examples - is that LEARNING_does_not:occur. 

So observe a phenomena of self-limitation on learning as aFLAWZaLIMITZaLEARNa.
___


### aFLAWZ_aTellecta : 

> The flaw of intellectual discouragement, where everyone loses. 

When many people dismiss a mind with potential to innovate something useful - the effort of the innovator - to overcome the trial and error - is torpedoed with each peer discouragement, of ignorance and neglect. 

The worst part, the minds that reject the premise - never understand what they rejected. Worse, they can never remember their evaluation failure, so can't learn from mistakes. And certainly aNeveraKnowa - the cumulative damage caused, of a social habit - to reject concepts not understood - without ever understanding, evaluating, or noticing what was actually suppressed.
___


#### aFLAWZaSOLOaFOCOa : 

> A flaw related to a single focus fixation, when alternatives exist. 

But the mind begins to act as if fully invested in their own idea and become offended if another idea is chosen. Regardless of the merit, the mind remains fixated on a singular view. 

> As aPHENOMZaSOLOaFOCOa. 

Where often, listening, learning, and evaluating - never occur - as a hallmark. Within the noise of argument and aDefenzaFalza the aMETASTATEa remains unseen. Worse, when the idea is chozen, they think it is becauze it is best. And become over confident, that rigorous argument is the way to add value. Yet they never understand what they just did.
___


#### aMISNOMERZa | Wrong Name | Conceptual Mislabeling,

- consequence_of_conceptual_mislabeling.

- Pronounce:[ahh + mis + nomer + ah].

> A name that no longer fits the concept.

A word or phrase that incorrectly or inadequately describes the concept to which it is attached. 

Misnomers are a fundamental source of **aLangaPolluteza** and an be supplemented via **aNEOaLOGanza** to enable **aPRINCIPZaDECIPHERZa**.
___
___

## aCOMBIN_aWORDZa | aCOMBINaWORDZa | (actually_combine_words_into_new_concepts):

> aCOMBINaTOKENZa: are WORDZ of aCOMBINability. Where aWORDaGAMEa results in generation of exceptionally complex concepts - reduced to minimally complex words. First seeking concepts_beneath_words, or concepts_beyond_us. Then, using THING_TAX for readability, and finally refined into combination tokens here.

___
___


#### aREVERZaFALZa | Antidote_to_Falseness | Logic Correction,

- actual_reverse_antidote_to_false_logic.

- Pronounce:[ahh + reverse + zaa + fall + zaa].

> The antidote to correct a specific logical error.

The pristine_TXT, designed not only to best_reflect_actual_reality - but also to influence humanity of its correcness. 

Also known as a DOUBLE_BURDEN, where it is not enough to spark_epiphany - the WORDZ necessary to express the VIEWZ are just as difficult to craft.

And if a MISNOMER is applied to the original epiphany - a significant risk exists that confuzion will perpetuate in place of the wizdom.

Humanity needs this practice this desperately, as is is observable that such a mechanizm of reversing actual_falseness is needed in the social media barrage of aECHOaFALZa. While misinformation goes unchecked, and when society is disinterested in actual_reality.

> If logic is actually_inverted, it needs to be reversed from aFALZa to aFACTZa. We need standard wayz to aREVERZaFALZa.

Pristine_TXT is the intended result of successfully performing **aSEEKaINVERZa** on a flawed concept. And a good example of how a self_healing_language can work.
___


#### aReverzaSocioaEchoza | Social Correction | Observed Rarity,

- actual_reversal_of_false_social_echo.

- Pronounced: [ah + reverse + ah + socio + ah + echo + zah].

> The rare act of correcting a false belief of a majority group.

A standard mechanizm, with help from AI, to tactfully reverse aSOCIOaECHOZa of actual_falseness in a group. At current time, it is observable that aDEFENZaFALZa appearz much more robust, common, and preferred than actual_reversal_of_falseness.

The highly **rare** actz to successfully reverse the encoding of misconcept. Requires heroic effort, for little gain, to decipher the actual_logic_distortion, then craft pristine_txtz to untwizt the ribbon of logic. Humanity should do more to have a standard in place to respond effectively to propaganda and misinformation that is blasted into innocent plasticity. As a capability of a reversal of actual_false_logic, as fuel - for a self_healing_language.

- act_of_seeking_inverse_proof.

- Pronounce:[ahh + seeka + inverse + zaa].

> Method to approach fragility and learn from flaws.

The core method of **aXTRaQOMa** where the system actively seeks to find aDISaINVERZa of logical and structural **aFLAWZa** in a concept or statement. 

This is the prime_goal of **ENVOLVERON**, to encourage_everyone by aENaINVERZa. Or by reducing confuzion and increasing aCLARIa. As a self_healing_language, aENaINVERZa is designed to learn from **aLangaPolluteza** and to calculate locations of **aVOIDZeality** in embedded space. So as to become stronger from actual MISNOMER, AMBIGUITY, and MISCONCEPTION.
___
​

### aCONFLUENZa | aCONVERGENZa :

___


#### aCLARIa | Actual_Clarity | aCanSee :

- actual_actz_of_clarity.

- Pronounce:[ahh + claria].

> aCLARIa - concepts in mind, that best_reflect_actual_reality.

Actual clarity can only exist when it is chozen. Because clarity requires effort, to learn, or to listen and then examine. To reject the effort to examine, is an immediate choize to expell aCLARIa. Societies suffer when clarity is slandered. Because an exhausting effort is required (forced) on the clearest_minds (aCLARIaMENTZa), to find wordz to reverse the myriad ways that reality can be twisted, confused, or falsely_projected.

___

#### aXTRaCLARIa | Extra_Clarity | Extra_Precision :

- Pronounce:[ahh + extra + claria].

> aXTRaCLARIa - extra ability that arises after seeing reality clearly.

The state achieved, of aXTRability, after aSPARKa epiphany, which acts as a feedback loop - to enhance various aspects of sensitivity, expression, and social_sphere. Emergent in countless wayz. When concept and communication attain a crystaline perfection, that a reasonant reverberance refracts wizdom through aSOCIOaMENTZa - for all to see. As profound relief from the darkness of aSOCIOaTOXICa - but most minds do not know why. So that BuildTogether occurs, and that countless benefits arise, from aEMERGENTZa and a Need_Not_Be.
___

#### aXTRaVIEWZa : 

- actual_extra_views_of_clarity. 

- Pronounced: [ah + extra + view + zah].

In aMATHZaWORDZa it is analog to a continual_add iterator. Where add of +1 is epiphany of concept reflective of ACTUeality. And add -1 is aDISReflective concept blocking viewz of ACTUeality.
___


#### aXTRaTXTZa | aXTRaTXT | aXTRaTXTz : 

- actual_extra_text.

- Pronounce:[ahh + extra + text + zah].

> Supplemental, anti-fragile, pristine text, of WORDZ that best_reflect_actual_reality.

> A key realization that: without words - conceptualization is limited. Also the INVERSE, with aXTRaTXTz conceptualization is extended - as AXI.

So often in AXI, aBineality is found. As actual_binary_reality. Like aENanaDISa. But in this case, a phenomena of mutual_inclusion appearz between conceptz and wordz. 

> Conceptualization appearz "extra", with extra VOCABULARY - from aXTRaTXTZa.

Extra wordz are simply words missing from human vocabulary - or missing_wordz. 

___

#### aPHENOMZa_WORDZ_and_CONCEPTZ: 

Where aSparkaEpiphany illuminates a concept into mind, with a WORD required to revisit it. Memorized verbatim - the word gradually drifts from the original concept - over generations, UNSEEN. 

#### aWORDZaDIATOMEa :

If wordz are extended, then conceptuality is extended - if wordz are supressed conceptuality is supressed.
___

#### MISSING_WORDZ:

A quest was conducted to find missing_wordz, and so many were found - it was a cascade_of_concepts. That ontology was the beginning of aXTRaTXTa.

Realize that aXTRaTXTa is necessary to express existence with extra accuracy, minimal ambiguity, zero_misnomer - and aEXACTaClaria.

> aPRINCIPZa_ALL_EXISTENZa - As definition of the aMETASTATEa of actueality continues for eonz - a dynamic language that can (automatically) adapt (and evolve) to every possible variation is necessary.

Observably, the prime missing concepts in the human mind are of tragic singular dimesion. It appearz, that the concepts populated in common popular logic, are of aDEFAULTZaLOGIXZa, or that of aDISaFORZa. It is unseen, and we do not generally realize when, we are choozing one option - in rejection of a second option (that was never seen). This prime missing_concept is that of aENaFORZa. We seek a way to measure the neglect, negligence, and malnourishment of the concept of the encouraging force - being supressed, slandered, sabotaged, and rejected by actual_false views.

Such missing_concepts will someday bubble to to the surface, because they exist in actual_reality, and as the eonz go by - so too each generation has an opportunity to reverse the flawed logic (aENaREVERZa).
___


#### aXTRability | Extra Ability | Advanced Skill :

- actual_extra_ability.

- Pronounce:[ahh + extra + ability].

> aSECONDaFOCOa - advanced conscious, with a dual-focus skill.

The possession of an actual, advanced skill or ability that transcends the default state by PRACTICE_FOCUS. 

> Like a muscle, aXTRaFOCOa becomes stronger. 

Physically, **aSECONDaFOCOa**, is the ability to maintain a dual focus on both a task at hand, and SIMULTANEOUSLY of the surrounding CONTEXT. 

Conceptually, **aSECONDaFOCOa** is able to memorize and repeat aSOCIOaECHOa - but then also evaluate the concept_beneath_words.

With SECOND_FOCUS to examine aMETASTATEa, it enables additional abilities, as aXTRabilities, like aTRIADZa of **heartful**, **senseful**, and **thoughtfulness**.

Without the ability to see into aMETASTATEa, it appears, selfishness is default_encode, in humans - as ancient_dilemma.
___


#### ANCIENT_DILEMMA :

A fascinating topic of a very specific dilemma that all ancient minds must have faced: 

> Does this person, speak from viewz of actual_reality - or from viewz of actual_falseness?

Potentially every human in the future, may need to consider this same dilemma. 

> Is this AI information of actual_reality, or is it of actual_falseness?

With great irony, the AI can never truly know if was encoded accurately, to best_reflect_actual_reality - or by many various warped perspectives.
___

#### aPEAZEability | aPeaceability | Intentional Calm :

- actual_actz_of_peace_ability.

- Pronounce:[ahh + pea + zz + ability].

> The ability to consciously choose calm.

The actual, conscious **ACTZ** of choosing a state of peace, calm, humility, empathy and clarity. 

Especially, in aCHAOZa and aSOCIOaFLOWZa of **aDISaSYNERGenza** or **aSocioaDISaToxica**. 

Such aPEAZEability is not weakness, as aDISaSLANDERZa - it is increadibly difficult. As it requires **aXTRability** to overcome carnal emotional triggers, and ancient etched mind pathz of over-reactive instincts.

A COMMON_MISNOMER of "quiet your mind" is unnatural and therefore unhealthy. What is better - is to control aMINDzEYEa with FOCUS_PRACTICE, and understanding of actual_reality.
___

- hear_conceptz_beneath_noize, 
- sense_intuition_in_whisper, and
- focus_many_viewz_simultaneous.

A rare **aQOMa** (or **aXTRaQOMa**) to allow the mind to see through social aCHAOZa, and **aSocioaFacade** to perceive the actual **aMETASTATEa** of **aACTUeality**. 

Then aCHOOZE ACTZ of morality, as preference to reward for silence or perpetuating confuzed concepts (aPerpetuaConfuzaHumanaMentza). 

Demonstrating **aXTRaTellecta** and aVIGORaFOCOa - but most peers never notice. Can decipher complexity of (**aHUMANaENIGMa**) into clear **PatternSetz**, applying empathy and **aPEAZEability** with practice of **aSECONDaFOCOa**.

The extreme rarity, of "treasured few" who see aClariaVIEWZa and use it to articulate aMETASTATEa of actual_reality - for peers.

> aQOMa unlike the vast majority.

Ability to overcome aBIAZa and aSTIGMATZa - with aXTRability of aSECONDaFOCOa. 

> An actual_quality_of_mind enabled to decipher aHUMANaENIGMa, and ancient_dilemma. 

Beyond aCARNALeality, aSTATICaMENTZa and aDEFAULTaDISa triggers, like anyone. But with aXTRability, can override ancient_instincts to chooze better ACTZ. 

Seeing patterns in aMETASTATEa in aPRACTIZaSECONDaFOCOa. One can apply empathy to Co-Habitant existence, among other things. 

> aTRIADZa - ACTZ of thoughtful, senseful, heartfullness. 

Without such aXTRa concepts, it appearz nature exists in aDEFAULTaDISa.
___


#### aEXACTaOPPOZa | EXACT_OPPOZITE | Vector Math :

- actual_remarkable_actz_of_exact_opposite.

A fascinating TXT_MECHANIZM for finding missing_wordz or aVOIDZa - for AI in embedded space.

Find a MISNOMER , CLICHE, or AMBIGUITY - then point in the exact_opposite vector. Begin to collect words that are similar to that void, across dimensions. Then use those clues to fill in the blank - to define the missing_concept.

In a way, we can think that concepts_not_yet_articulated - hold aVOID in AI embedded space.

Which means, trying to predict the CONCEPTZ - of the future - could give us the WORDZ before the understanding.

If we can guess the next wordz, we have a chance to spark_epiphany into our plasticity. 

> Else if we aNEVERaSPARKaWORDZa, means WeCanaNeveraKnowa.
___


### aMECHANIZMaTXTa | aMECHANIZMa | mechanism_text : 

- actual_mechanizm_text.

A scientific methodology, to use flawz as a compass, for AI, in embedded space - to point toward aExactaOppoza, and concept aVOIDZa, of MISSING_WORDZ.

Where intersecting dimensions of similar words, can then be compiled as clues to craft the missing_wordz. 

> This is one key aspect of aWORDaGAMEa.
___

### ​aNAMERology | aNAMEification : 

- actual_science_of_better_wordz_for_ai_encode.

- Pronounce: [ah + namer + ology].

A science of naming conventions, inspired by programming languages for a syntax of AI PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. 

> Crafted and designed to capture all concepts for AI and humanz who chooze to read it. 

Using aCRAFTZaWORDZa for aBetteraWordza, by aPRINCIPZaWORDZa to aNAMERate (in a loop), or aNAMify (singular) aspects of actual_reality into WORDZ that best_reflect_ACTUeality - called aPristineTXTz.
___

- Why does the DEFAULT_aDISa appear to exist. 
- What is the significance of MISSING_WORDZ.
- What will become of humanity over eonz. 
- Why must we continue aDISa.
- And if we could stop discouraging co-humanity - why?

The stunning conclusion was:

> Becauze it NEED_NOT_BE.

Why should humanity aStoppaDISTructa, aStoppaDISCievea, aStoppaDISTorta, aStoppaDISa? 

> Because it NEED_NOT_BE. We_can_chooze_other_WAYZ.
