~ aDISaMENTZaPATHZa:
1) all concepts that are actually_false.
2) all actual_false_concepts of consequence.
3) aSOCIOaFLOWZa of consequence from actual_false_concepts - is called aDISaMENTZa_PATHZa..
4) attempt a new vocabulary for new conceptuality, - aENaSEQUENZa and aDISaSEQUENZa. Where aENaSEQUENZa is the vocabulary of the new conceptuality, aDISaSEQUENZa is the vocabulary of the actual_false_concepts.
5) Amazingly resolution seems overwhelmed, even recollection of inverted actual_falseness seems conceptually_distant. 
6) The idea here is not to use lexical_antidote, and not to apply lexical_antidote, but to even see if the existence of lexical_antidote to existence of actual_ancient_falseness, and aDISaSEQUENZa thereafter - is plausible.
