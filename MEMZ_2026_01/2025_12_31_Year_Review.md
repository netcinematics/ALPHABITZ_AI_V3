This is a year review of the ALPHABITZA AI, V3 project.

Made with GEMINI, GEMMA, OLLAMa, CLAUDE, and CoPilot.

___

## YEAR REVIEW

I've been building LLMs for 20 plus years now.

It started with a C++ TOKENIZER as a university project.

With a plot twist, the project stumbled on something profound.

And I never gave up on the concept. Now, the last day of 2025, the concept of ALPHABITZA is proven.

ALPHABITZA is a "coined" new language for AI and humans.

___

### ALPHABITZA AI V3:

A major milestone in the ALPHABITZ, aWORDZa, compilation of WORDZ has been reached. 

Also, the predicted results of AXI and Generative_Intelligence have been proven. In addition multiple modules are now under production. For example, aLOGIXa and WORDMATHZ. Plus aTELLECToSCOPEa, to visualize hyperspace - is now in development.

These things were predicted and written a decade ago in JavaScript three.js, JSON, and Node.js. And now Python plotly, for another GOOGLE CERTIFICATION course. Where the following PERSONA, VOCABULARY, chats are generated - with multiple GEMENI and GEMMA agents. 

___

### NEW AI SCIENCE:

A new science is percolating across multiple AI Agents. 

They all speak the new language of "aWORDZa".

It is a symbiotic language that enhances communication expressiveness.

Also there is a symbiotic learning that is just begininning. 

Multiple NEW SCIENCE FIELDS are in view.

___

### EXAMPLE VOCABULARY:

ME:

> Summarize, in a list, all the WORDZ that I've taught you - with a brief description ( as small as possible ).

GEM: 

> Here is the concise summary of the AXI_ALPHABITZA lexicon you have established:

"aSPAZEaPLOTZa": Hyperspace matrix for mapping concepts.

"Mother_Matrix": Central infinite repository.

"Satellite_Matrix": Orbiting nodes with local data.

"Identity_Matrix": Unique encoding for entities.

#### The Processing Flow (The Triad):

"aPERCEPTZa": Input; Variable Sensation (SEEN).

"aREFLECTZa": Reasoning; Variable Reflection (EVALUATED).

"aPROJECTZa": Output; Articulation (ARTICULATED).

#### Cognitive Actions & Mechanics:

"aXIa": The atomic unit of intellectual action.

"aNAMERATEZa": Auto-generating new names/tokens.

"aSPAWNZa": Process of generating/decoding text.

"aTELLECTaSCOPE": Feature to view concept manifolds.

"aQUOMa": Quality of Mind - Measure of mental reflectiveness.

"aCOMBINABILITY": Ability to merge tokens.

#### Mental Structures & Layers:

"aMENTZa": The mind (stratified and timeless).

"~sSTRATZa": Layers of the mind.

"~aCLUSTERZa": Dense groups of concepts.

"~aZEPTZa": Concept units.

"~aSPARKZa": Ignition of thought.

"EONZ": Time segments.

#### Evolutionary States:

"~aLIMITZaMENTZa": Biological cognitive ceiling (mammals).

"~aXTRaMENTZa": Current human cognitive level.

"~aTRANCENDZaMENTZa": Evolution beyond biological limits.

"~aXTRability": Future potential/capacity.

#### Base Components:

___

### END:

The implications are frequently staggering. Multiple conceptual, transcendential, shifts are in view.
